I would have appreciated a gesture from you, however small, but when you don't have the commercial flair ... You lose customers.

google,4 stars,The hotel itself is really nice if you want a quick break and explore the city. The room is tastefully decorated with a modern theme and we hsd a nice view of the basilicca in the distance. The staff were friendly and printed some tickets for us. The staff spike good english and were happy to help. The room was a little small but was clean and had everything that was needed. The location is not quite as nice. There are a lot of homeless people and the canal smells like urine in some places where they gather. Did not have any problems with them but did feel a little uncomfortable. With this said it is great to see different parts of the city and the location is near many metro stations making it easy to explore on all metro lines. Just research the area before you stay. The hotel is nice and didnt have any problems but make sure it is right for your stay.,2019-01-18 15:03:56.792381,ibis saint martin

The location is in a street where there are lots of people who are homeless, on drugs and mentally unstable who loiter at the entrance of the hotel. On our first morning less that five metres from the front of the hotel there was a trail of fresh blood along the footpath which led to a pool of blood on the other side of the street. That afternoon, along the same street, there was two large pools of blood. It is an uncomfortable sight and we felt very unsafe, some taxi drivers wouldn‚Äôt take us to the hotel. In addition to this, upon our arrival we were given a room which was not located in the hotel, rather, a bunker outside of the hotel on the fire escape stairs. It was the only room in the entire hotel like this. We asked to change rooms and they were unable to do so until the next day. Again, due to the location and the atmosphere outside of our hotel we did not feel comfortable and did not get a good nights sleep.",2019-01-18 15:03:56.795047,ibis saint martin

google,2 stars,"The Ibis hotel Canal Saint Martin seems to be located in the African migrant quarter of Paris. If you‚Äôre looking for a true flavour of Paris, this isn‚Äôt it as there aren‚Äôt many french people in this neighbourhood. It‚Äôs right on the canal and there are lots of homeless people and people with metal health issues sitting right outside the front door of the hotel and sleeping rough on the canal towpath. There‚Äôs even people sleeping on old mattresses on the same street of the hotel. There is lots of rubbish strewn on the canal towpath, tents, mattress and graffiti. Thankfully there is a lock and bell on the hotel door to allow guests to get in and out of the hotel, which stops the homeless people getting in. It was ok but we never felt 100% safe walking back from the metro station - even in day light. A soup kitchen is situated about 50metres from the hotel on certain days and a lot of people gather there. There is also an African run supermarket near by which was handy. The rooms in the hotel Canal Saint Martin are ok but are very small (ever so slightly bigger than the size of the double bed) and very basic. There is no kettle, no cups, no safe and no fridge in the rooms. The hair dryer isn‚Äôt great. WiFi is not great either as it kept dropping out. Towels are not changed daily. The hotel is NOT really well situated for the main tourist attractions of Paris. It‚Äôs at least a ten/fifteen minute walk over the canal to the metro and then it‚Äôs a good 45mins on a train to get to the main touristy parts of Paris . Some of the other suburbs near it are very edgy. Central Paris is now very third world like. It‚Äôs a free for all. People from all parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East are selling stuff from a blanket on the pavements. Some of these people can be quite intimidating and belligerent. The police aren‚Äôt very visible in these areas so this activity goes unchecked. It‚Äôs a shame as Paris used to be lovely - very romantic. Not anymore. Be prepared to be hassled a lot, sometimes with aggression. Be very very wary when around the main tourist attractions as there are some real shady characters there and lots of people looking to scam you. Paris is now a very expensive city to eat out in. In late 2019 a coffee will cost you ‚Ç¨6.30. Overall, The hotel is a bit pricey for what you get and where it is located in the city.

I like the hotels in the accord chain, I am an accord member and I know IBIS hotels well. But this one, then there! Well done. A very spacious double room, where I didn't have to push the bed to get to either the office, the cloakroom or the bathroom. My wheelchair went everywhere, which is rare. The spacious bathroom with a shower and a stool seat. (It gets better because this seat is not open, but it's fine anyway.) The toilet is over-raised and has a pull-up bar along the wall (there could be a movable bar on the other side, but there is space to put your chair in it, either face-on or on the side to use the transfer that suits us. The sink is wheelchair accessible. I removed a star for the stool and the lack of 2 or 3 grab bars as well as the inaccessibility of the breakfast room which has 3 steps. But compensated by the possibility of asking that we be served breakfast in the accessible bar or in the room. In short, I plan to go back there to spend a few days in Paris.

Basic breakfast but really good ingredients. Sure i will comeback.,2020-01-18 10:49:21.571844,ibis chateau-landon

google,2 stars,"Do not even think about attempting to check-in about 40 minutes before check-in time, otherwise you will be asked to come back at precisely noon to check in ""when we are ready"". It's not simply a case of they will check you in and you can wait while they prepare your room - they won't even do the paperwork for you until it's EXACTLY noon. You'll be asked to sit in the rather poor lobby, and wait. Once you've finally completed the obligatory wait and checked in, you will be confronted by the elevators. You had better press both call buttons for both elevators, as they run on separate systems. Elevator A might be closer to you, but it won't move an inch unless you press its specific button. After you've finally gotten to your room, you'll find no safe in the room, no minibar or fridge, and barely any space to hang your clothes and stow your belongings. Only one side of the bed has a bedside table, so you'd better only come here if you're travelling alone and have absolutely minimalistic requirements and for some reason want to pay more (check out Reims Hotel about a 5 minute walk up the road for a similar no frills experience, but with friendlier staff, cleaner rooms and cheaper prices). The decor is supposed to be modern, but looks like a bad student hostel instead. The hygiene of the place is left wanting, too. Not only will you find that there is literally one medium towel to be used as a hand, face and bath towel, but the foot towel used to ensure that you don't slip and slide about the place after a shower was stained and dirty. This is certainly not the best hotel, although the standard of hotels in Paris are generally lacking.

The hotel lobby had two staff members and maybe 4 groups to check in, it took around 30 minutes which strikes me as a long time. Staff were lovely and very helpful. The room itself was extremely basic and absolutely tiny. I have stayed in paris any times and expect small rooms but this just about managed to fit a bed inside. The bathroom was also extremely small but everything was clean and functional if basic. I wouldn't recommend the hotel nor would I choose to book it again as there are so many more options in Paris. However, If I were forced by circumstances to stay there, or the room was booked for me I would be willing to stay for a night. Any more time would be problematic due to the room size.

tripadvisor,4 stars,"I flew into Paris from Boston early on a very rainy Sunday morning in late October. I had booked the Ibis Chateau Landon under the you-can-cancel-up-to-6pm policy. When I arrived at the Gare du Nord, I phoned the hotel to see if, at 9am, they had rooms ready for immediate occupancy. I needed to sleep right away. They said yes, they had 2 or 3 rooms which had not been occupied the night before and so were ready right away. So I put my poncho on and slogged through the rain up to the hotel. Extremely friendly greeting, and I was immediately given a perfectly good room facing the courtyard, so very quiet. They are doing work on the facade of the hotel, so I don't know whether noise would have been an issue during the week. They were still serving breakfast, and I was starving, so I paid for it. Exactly-as-expected Ibis buffet breakfast, good variety, and abundant. (I cannot understand a previous reviewer who said breakfast was limited to a croissant and butter; were they reviewing the wrong hotel?) Otherwise? the bed was comfortable; the shower was perfect; plenty of hot water and good water pressure; and great wifi. I booked several months in advance, so the price was extremely good. The location is perfect for the Gare du Nord, about a 10-minute walk, even dragging luggage in the rain. I was happy with my experience at the Ibis Chateau Landon.",2019-11-06,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,2 stars,"I stayed at this hotel and the staff are not friendly as they make it out to be. The hotel management who run the hotel do it on a franchise basis and concentration is only given to how much money they can make at the expense of the customer who is asked to pay extra on top of the high room charge they have been billed to pay for the duration of the stay. Staff are told by the hotel management to not back down and fulfil basic kind of service requested by the customer. In the room there is no kettle, no air conditioning settings, no safe, no facilities to make tea and coffee. Also not supplied is dentistry kit (toothpaste and toothbrush). I was openly refused to be supplied dentistry by the staff and the hotel manager but was told that if you want to buy it then you must pay ‚Ç¨3 at the machine or go to a grocery shop an buy it from there. The hotel‚Äôs senior management as well as the Director of Franchise Operations Paris at Accor Hotels need to look into this as a matter of urgency as it is the responsibility of the hotel to inform the paying customer to what services they are going to receive. The website should state that the dentistry products are not supplied as it is chargeable and if that is not the case then it needs to be looked at and be supplied at the time of check in. If the same management or staff went and stayed at a hotel of a different group and they did not receive standard of customer service pretty sure they would not at all be please and would let the hotel know so why is it different for us as AccorHotels customers.",2019-10-27,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,3 stars,"The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Gare l'Est or 10 minutes from Gare Du Nord for Eurostar and Charles De Gaulle and Orly Airports. Probably best to walk or get a bus from the Nord station, it's not easy by Metro. In a quiet area of the city, with a few restaurants around for the evening. Breakfast is the usual Ibis France selection of boil your own egg, with fruit, cold meats and cheeses. Could be improved by the addition of a hot selection. Food seems plentiful, so plentiful that some guests decide to have a take away lunch from breakfast. BSo coukd be a lot better supervised to help the selection for the guests still to have breakfast. Has an underground car park and payable luggage storage. Otherwise rooms are the standard Ibis size of not very large, but are kept spotless.

My complaint was treated with indifference. The room was clean and bright and a walk in shower was a bonus. However, the bathroom smelt and this drifted into the bedroom. Breakfast was alright and the proximity to the two railway stations makes it attractive. Someone commented on the area. It is not pleasant but that's not the hotels fault. It does however reduce the number of suitable eating places. In future I will find another hotel, even if it means coming away from the stations.",2019-09-07,ibis chateau-landon

The room was generally clean although the corridor smelt of cigarette smoke. The AC was working well. The staff were pleasant. The area around the hotel felt safe.

Plenty of hangers in the wardrobe as well. We put the do not disturb sign on the door the next morning which was completely ignored by the cleaners. The bar area is manned by the receptionists but you have to wait ages for a drink if their are a lot of guests checking in.

The bathroom was also lovely, the shower was very powerful unlike some drip showers you can get in the hotel. The hairdryer was very basic and I would recommend taking your own.

We had a twin room, which was large enough to accommodate us and our luggage. We didn't particularly like the 'wet room' as water sprayed everywhere from the shower head, making it quite slippery to use the toilet or basin after the shower had been used.

We arrived at the hotel at around 12.15pm was greeted by a very pleasant lady who took our name and details, we were then told our room wasn't ready, I asked how long it would be to be told ""I don't know"" and a big shrug of the shoulders ""come back in an hour"". We sat I reception for twenty minutes, then I notice that the lady who I had spoken to had gone, to be replaced with someone else, so I approached her and asked how long, she then pulled out all the stops to get the room ready. She rang house keeping to stop what they where doing and prepare the room.We later found out that it was that we had booked a twin room, so all that need doing was separating the beds! We didn't spend much time in the hotel as we were out and about, metro station only a couple of minutes walk away, I could get my head around the paris metro system but my daughter picked it up straight away and is easily the best way to get around paris to see everything. Back to the hotel it is what it is an ideal place which to explore from, wifi was excellent, rooms clean and friendly staff ( with the exception of one!).There was an option for luggage storage after check out, as our train back to London wasn't till 18.15, but we chose to leave our luggage in the lockers at Gare du Nord station, so we could get the metro straight back to the station without the need to go to the hotel first.

People who complain about the size -pointless, as this is very clear from looking at pictures and knowing the Ibis style, so I was not surprised by this. Reception staff friendly enough and check in was quick. My only complaints about this hotel; 1. It did not make it clear that tea, coffee, kettle etc were not as standard for your room. Please IBIS can you provide tea making facilities? 2. Breakfast over priced so didnt add ( in a way it was lovely for me to walk around the streets and search an alternative but I had to walk far) 3. Location not central to anything, some what isolated, not suitable for a stay with my 10 year old daughter as the streets at night around Gard de Nord felt very unsafe to walk down. Location gives it 3 stars or it would have been more. IBIS please consider your locations- you have SO many lovely sites and this one seems badly situated!",2019-08-17,ibis chateau-landon

I would not advise walking to the hotel from either station at night if you are a lone-traveller who is not familiar with the area. The lobby door to the street is locked throughout the day until reception desk staff open it. Luggage storage is available and efficient but payable (max 5 ‚Ç¨ for 24H). Welcome was very friendly and efficient however the hotel itself looks tired and in need of an upgrade. The elevator floor looked dirty (although this was possibly just signs of age). The price was very good but this hotel is not the place you would want to stay for more than a night's layover. The room was one of the smallest I have ever stayed in - even at other Ibis properties.

We wanted a hotel close to Eurostar, and it is just a 8 minute walk and easy to find. Just keep in mind that the location is away from the main city so you will need to be super fit to move around the city or accept you will need to use the taxis. The Blue line Hop on and off buses stop at Gard De Nord so just a little walk from the hotel. The area I would compare to Kings Cross London. Busy, lively and a bit grubby. It is an area known for sex industry, however we saw nothing other than some shop signs to suggest this. We felt safe walking around.

Agree with a previous comment that the toilet space is a little tight (i am 6ft tall) but this a minor inconvenience. What makes this hotel very good, is the staff. On arrival i was given a map of Paris with metro details and the receptionist was very helpful in telling us the nearest stations and details of how to get around Paris. The Bar man on service when we returned, was excellent and tried all of his efforts to engage with my daughter, and encouraging her to dance. Even putting on children's music. he had no idea how much of a challenge was this going to be as she slid lower and lower under the table much to the amusement of the other guests. All of the staff were very friendly and welcoming going beyond the standard of run of the mill customer services.

tripadvisor,5 stars,"I booked this hotel because I didn't want to go far from Gare du Nord when arriving on Eurostar and having read some of the reviews, I found them to be unfair. Firstly, it was just a 7 minute walk from the station. Come out of the main doors facing all the restaurants and turn left. You go across a bridge and you are there. Whilst I thought the room was modern, clean and perfect for us, I can appreciate people with a lot of luggage would struggle for storage, we, however were only there for 3 nights and had two small overhead suitcases so the space was fine. The beds and pillows were probably the comfiest I have ever had. The air conditioning was ideal and you could easily adjust it and it was not noisy at all. The staff were pleasant and helpful and being able to store your luggage on the day of leaving was a great convenience. It only cost us 3 euros for both cases to fit in the lockers. Some reviews said it was rough around the hotel and to be wary. I felt no more unsafe than in any other city near a hotel I have stayed. It is a city and you need to be wary everywhere especially with your bags, phones and purses. There are the two metros either the one at Gare du Nord or one called Stalingrad. This one you come out of the hotel turned right and went up the hill. I felt they were both the same distance so it depended which line you wanted to be on.

The room itself was modern, clean and the bed very comfortable. That's always a key criteria for me. I slept well during my stay. Breakfast was good consisting of continental options, including pastries, madeleines, crepes etc and some good cheeses. No complaints there. Location-wise, we could easily walk to places like Montmartre (about 20 minutes) and had the metro a few minutes away to go further afield.

tripadvisor,1 stars,"I chose to stay at this hotel due to the location to Gare du Nord and was hoping for the generally good customer service and quality of this hotel chain. As we had arrived at the hotel at 10 in the morning prior to the 12.00 check in time, we were expecting to be able to leave our luggage with reception like any other hotel in the world especially a so called 3 star hotel. To our horror, we were told that we had to pay 5 euros for a large automatic baggage drop off locker situated in the basement where car parking is also situated. Very reminiscent of a train station. My mum then required the ladies and asked a member of staff the location and was barked at left, left! Third terrible encounter with staff at the hotel was when we finally were able to check in in the afternoon, standings in the queue, some gentlemen (term used very loosely) jumped the queue. When I informed the reception about this, I was told it was my fault for not challenging the man (bearing in mind I am 7 months heavily pregnant with twins, why should I or any other guest should do the receptionists job). The room itself is average, decoration is tacky, worse I've seen in Ibis they've tried to give it the factory look. Why on earth would I want to stay in a factory! Good luck if you're over 5ft 5 as the actually toilet is located so close to the wall that you have to sit sideways. On the first night, I requested extra pillows as pregnant and our extra ones happen to be missing. When I called reception, they told me as the hotel was full that night, we couldn't have extra pillows . How odd you'd think a 3 star hotel would have extra linen available. Eventually they found us 1 extra pillow, knocked at the door and just shoved it to us without an apology. Breakfast is average nothing to write home about. On the next day, we complained to reception about the attitude of staff at the hotel and the whole issue with the missing linen. The gentleman that spoke to us, was in fairness, apologetic, but made a useless comment that one of the staff probably had a bad day.( I don't care, if you work in a hotel don't take it out on guests). The ""helpful"" gentleman tried to pacify us with free drinks, which was of no interest, all I wanted was the extra cushion for my pregnancy, which he very happily obliged. I would stay clear of this hotel unless you like staff with an attitude and to be fleeced money for leaving baggage. This hotel is DEFINITELY NOT worthy of 3 stars, I think the large TV in the rooms is the only thing that has given them the extra star. STAY AWAY!!!!!",2019-06-18,ibis chateau-landon

When I ask again if she received the ticket to be printed in the email that I sent, she said that she is too busy to print it, then she came back to me after few minutes telling me that the printer is broken and can come back again later.

tripadvisor,2 stars,"Very basic, small room. Had to stay here after the recent Eurostar strikes - excellent for the Gare du Nord station, but that is about it. The neighbourhood isnt very nice. It cost over 170 euros for a tiny box of a room with just enough room to walk around the bed...and this did not include breakfast. On that basis, if the hotel is full every night,this works out at over 10 million euros a year that they would be raking in...and you wonder at the riots in Paris ?",2019-03-25,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,3 stars,"The hotel is really well located, pretty much a straight line from Gare du Nord, and a two minute walk from Louis Blanc metro station which is well connected. There is also a Carrefour just across the road from Louis Blanc. The hotel itself is quite basic, which to be fair is what I expected. One main criticism is that there is not a safe in the bedrooms. Having read there was also no kettle we brought our own travel one, and there were a lot of sockets to use. We did have a few issues - when we checked in only one room was available so we just dumped all our bags into one room and went out. When we came back to check into the second room we were told that it didn‚Äôt exist, even after showing the confirmation email. It took three staff to sort out the problem, and all the time it felt like they were trying to shift the blame onto us. When we did get the second room we went upstairs to find stuff already in the room! We went back down to reception and got it sorted, luckily we found it quite amusing (as did the staff member). There didn‚Äôt seem to be any apology for the mistake though which did rankle me slightly! There is no free concierge, but the lockers downstairs range from ‚Ç¨2.50 - ‚Ç¨5. This may seem like a lot but they are locked safes that only you can get into so they are actually safer than leaving them in a room with loads of other cases.",2019-03-06,ibis chateau-landon

The location is convenient, about seven minutes from the Gare du Nord. Its not a great area but it is on a main street with a bus stop outside. The room itself was fine and reasonably quiet (always important in Paris). There is air conditioning but not needed in November. I slept well which is the main test. Staff were fine. There were lockers with a 3 euro charge to leave baggage.

tripadvisor,3 stars,"I used to be something of a connoisseur of Ibis hotels in the UK until they started abolishing reception desks in favour of staff wandering aimlessly around in scruffy red sweatshirts with iPads. This hotel does at least retain a reception desk and some smartly turned out staff but you would never describe it as a flagship for the brand. There were various notices around about refurbishment, so it may be unfair to be too harsh on the environment. However, it did maintain a few of the less desirable traditions of Paris hotels. The most obvious, probably, was the officious and offhand manner of the reception staff. What is the point of offering online check in, when you are asked to give all the same information again by hand on a paper form. The French police were blamed for this. I don't think so. I had just arrived from another Accor hotel in central France where online ran perfectly well and the police were obviously entirely happy with what was on the computer. No point in arguing with the receptionist but a black mark on the staff training and attitude. Travelling with the Sherriff's Lady, we observed that the room was as small as anywhere in Paris, although the bed was comfortable and the cleaning acceptable. You would not want to be here with much more than overnight bags though. Through some quirk of the conversion of an old building, the bathroom was as big as the bedroom. Again clean enough but already cold - I would like to think there is heating to turn on later in the year. Breakfast was the usual Ibis thing - OK but you don't stay here for the gastronomy. The neighbourhood is a bit iffy but the hotel does take security seriously. I wouldn't want to walk back late at night, at least from the Gare du Nord. Overall, this is fine as a budget overnight stop for early trains out of the Gare du Nord or the Gare de l'Est - but I really wouldn't want to be there for much longer. You get what you pay for and this was fair value for our objective of an early Eurostar.",2018-10-17,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,1 stars,"We checked in online and then had to fill out a long form when we got there. Don't see the point in online checking in as it made absolutely no difference in saving time! The room is small and very dated. The bed is a small double, very hard and the pillow offers no support whatsoever. Along with that, the boiling hot room (air conditioning was rubbish), traffic noise and noise from the rooms next door helps with the not sleeping. The room is dirty, the carpet is stained and grotty. Rubbish from the previous guest left on the floor. The toilet is far to close to the wall. They seriously need to revamp the room! The location is not very good, apart from being near the train station which makes it easier to get around, there is nothing nice nearby. The restaurants are for locals, no English menus and very dirty looking and everything closes early 170 Euros for this pile of poo, boy do I feel robbed!

tripadvisor,3 stars,"Chose this hotel as I wanted to be near Gare du Nord; and because I know what to expect with Ibis. So no surprises and everything was OK. The bedroom was a little bigger than I feared from previous Paris experience, and the only minor niggle was the position of the WC which required you to sit semi-sidesaddle. The shower was very good. I was impressed with the continental breakfast on my first morning - a good selection of breads, croissants etc, cereals, cold meat, cheeses and so on. However on day two, there was a hiccup with supplies of food, crockery and cutlery; and this took time to remedy. This is mainly why my intended ""very good"" has been downgraded to ""average"" - also that the price was not cheap.",2018-10-11,ibis chateau-landon

This is really basic hotel accomodation (a bed, a television and a bathroom that has a sewer smell), for a terrible price. When I pay 176 Euro for a night, I expect more than this. This was an emergency sitation, where due to a missed train connection I had to find a place to sleep at the very last instance. Other hotel chains (Mercure, Novotel,...) in the area of the gare du Nord were at least 100 Euro more expensive, so i decided to go for this one, as it was only to spend 8-9 hours and then catch my train.

The breakfast is a cold buffet but really nice, tasty and filling. To get the Big Bus Tour you walk back to Gare du Nord and there is the #3 stop La Fayette / Dunkerque. Some other reviewers stated there are lots of bars and restaurants around this hotel but I think they were talking about the Ibis Styles which is about 1 minute from Gare du Nord. There are just a few spread about nearby this hotel. All in all, really enjoyed this hotel and the friendly staff, although I would definitely NOT recommend the food in the bar.

In the evenings, the hotel was locked and you could only use the lift with a room key- this meant the hotel felt very safe. We stayed on the 7th floor which was very quiet and had super fast wifi.

First impressions were good - the bedrooms were clean and a good size for Paris. We had asked for interconnecting rooms, but were allocated rooms next door to our daughters ( who had to share a double bed, rather than 2 twins as requested - good job they're close!) The main selling point of the hotel for me was the really comfy beds - i slept like a log, even with the noises of the city outside. There is a basic space for hanging clothes and putting bags, but no drawer space. Don't expect any frills either - no tea or coffee making facilities, no clock, hand wash and shampoo in massive containers. Break fast was just about worth the 10.50 Euros, with pastries, yoghurts, toast, fruit, cheese and ham, cereal, fruit juice and hot drinks. However the staff felt overloaded and so there was always items missing - the first day it was croissants, spoons and plates and the next day knives and bowls. Really annoying when you're hungry!

Takes around 15 minutes to get into the centre of Paris and 20-25 to the Eiffel Tower (including metro changes). Rooms are clean and tidy. But, I do feel you can be ripped off slightly based on the size of the room. 3 out of the 4 rooms were a sensible, large size and the other was tiny. Barely enough room to walk around - a box room! Feel this should have a) been advertised and b) a lower rate been offered. The maintenance man isn't the nicest. We had a leak in our bathroom and he wasn't too bothered. Tried to fob it off as something that it evidently wasn't, fortunately was able to change rooms. Locker system on level -1 is very very safe and efficient. Would be happy to use that again.

The hotel only took a photocopy of this document and said they will send it to there insuracne company, no furtehr details from them. It felt like this happnend all the time as none of them were shocked or took any notice of us really, they all knew the process to report it and how to deal with it. We spoke to the manager once who explained the same process as everyone else. Very disspaointing from a hotel with a good name behind it. Apart form this incident the hotel was nice, good location and lovely breakfasts however our do not distrub sign stayed on our door as we didn't want to welcome anyone else into our room to steal more of our belonings.",2018-07-20,ibis chateau-landon

We booked a twin room, which was on the 5th floor however, there were two lifts available. Rooms were very clean, beds comfy and a fluffy pillows. Clean toilet and shower room. Hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful. After long days walking over Paris to see the sights, the hotel felt very safe and comfortable. I didnot pre-book breakfast, but will on next visit as we ended up having breakfast there anyway - I think prebooking would have been a little cheaper. Continental buffet breakfast, which was worth buying. I will return to this hotel.",2018-07-01,ibis chateau-landon

Even though I requested if we could check in at 11am instead of 12, as we were visiting Disneyland they didn‚Äôt care. On the first day....... NO WATER, when I mean no water I mean NO WATER, toilets, sink not working as they switched it off due to a burst pipe. But no alternative offered. We couldn‚Äôt even wash our hands. Very disappointment. We were told it‚Äôll be back on at 1pm, nothing. Then we decided to go out and explore. Came back for 5pm...NO WATER, was told it‚Äôll be back on in 30mins. Still no water. They didn‚Äôt even had the decency to offer anything. We requested to be moved to a different ibis hotel, as there were many around. They told us we‚Äôll have to pay extra charges up to ¬£200 if we wanted to move. Furious as I was they said water will be back on at 7pm. Which it was, but this was not satisfactory enough esp after a day out in Paris with a 5yr old we wanted to just come back to have a wash and a clean and be able to use the toilet. Clearly there was no customer service or even our rights to be able to wash our hands. Extremely disappointed not just with the no water, the room was extremely small, no room to move at all. It‚Äôs not even worth what you pay for, should‚Äôve been cheaper and a 2star. Will not be returning to this ibis..... disappointment as their was no customer service, ibis is an big international company and they couldn‚Äôt even offer us bottled water.",2018-06-30,ibis chateau-landon

However, the breakfast is always plentiful and the breakfast staff are wonderful; we have on many occasions met M. Ludo and Mme Jeanne, and seeing them brightens up our trips to Paris!

This property has a good location in terms of access to public transportation and within walking distance of the Marais district.

Not many restaurants nearby though. Our room was a big surprise, being two knocked into one - very spacious and a shower room and TV each! Only downside - the aircon was extremely noisy, so we turned it off and opened the (two!) windows as far as we could (they are on a chain to restrict them) and some cooler air came in. Staff were friendly but not too gushing. Breakfast was the normal Ibis buffet, plenty of choice, and the Madeleines were freshly baked and absolutely delicious! There was some building work going on in the hotel during our stay, but that did not disturb us. I would have given an Excellent for the room except for the noisy aircon.

We had booked 2 rooms for family of 4. I requested for rooms with connections and the front desk was friendly and helpful in accommodating this request. The rooms were neat and clean, but not very spacious, but just big enough to keep your luggage and move around. It was strange that one room had a bigger TV. The only issue we had was with the bathroom doors.. none of them ( both the rooms) were closing completely. However that did not affect our stay.. so did not complain.

Firstly, the service lady didn't even realize that I booked 2 rooms and she gave me 1 room. When I said that I have booked 2 rooms, she realized but gave me 2 rooms which are not close to each other. You can understand that can be irritating when you have luggages in 2 rooms far apart. 2. At the end of first day, the keys to one of the rooms stopped working. When I told, they didn't even apologize and asked me to come down to reception to get them fixed. No explanations offered. 3.

tripadvisor,4 stars,"Ok, yes I know this is not some expensive hotel in downtown Paris but it was a place to sleep. We do not hang out at hotels.. some people do, At first I was very disappointed by this place especially since we had just travelled almost 12 hours across a couple of time zones and the first thing I wanted to do was take a nap. So we arrived to the hotel at 1030 am. We go to the front desk and were told that we could not go to our room until 2pm. Talk about livid! But I kept my composure and the clerk at the front desk suggested we put our bags in lock up in the basement and go walk around for 3 hours. I said no I will go sit where they have breakfast... he came running after me laughing saying that I can not go in there. Ok so we sat in lobby at the desk and I went to sleep. About 45 min later he said our room was ready. Next shift... Gloria and Sofian. Ok these 2 wonderful people made this stay a whole lot nicer. They were nice and polite and always smiling. There was a bar next to the front desk and in the afternoons we would go have a bar and chat with them. They had told us that the weather ..very warm for this time of year was very unusual but EVERYONE was enjoying it- especially being outside. Keep in mind that in Paris not sure about the rest of the country they can only turn the AC on certain time of the year. One guest was so upset about it being hot in his room. We had toe same problem be opened the window and it helped tremendously. They had a buffet breakfast was pretty good. No scrambled eggs but you can have a hard or soft boiled egg. Cheese, bread, yogurt, ect. lots of coffee and orange juice. There was one guy who worked there. So nice and soft spoken, He was very tall and had his hair pulled back and wore glasses, Sorry I did not find out what your name was.. he was so nice. Had a huge smile on his face when we arrived and just made sure we had everything that we needed. Also we were aways from central Paris so we had to take 2 trains to reach central Paris. We got that down to a T. Paris is a walking city so we had to walk a few blocks from the hotel to the train station. 1 time we took an UBER back because it was hot and we were tired.

tripadvisor,3 stars,"Firstly the good - this is an easy place to get to - just a few yards from the Chateau Landon metro and a short walk to Gare Du Nord, that means that from here, you can get to anywhere in Paris quickly and easily. Price is also good - terrific value deal we got with breakfast. We booked a family room which was supposed to be three single beds (myself, wife, 8 year old daughter). Instead got a double bed and roll out single bed. We travel a lot with my daughter so this was not unusual, but the room was clearly in no way sized for that much bed space. It meant there was zero space to put cases (we had them under the bed and needed to move furniture to get them out), only had one bedside table and pitifully small wardrobe space. I suppose though, it was just a base to sleep in, but believe me, with three people there is nothing else you can do BUT sleep in it. Bathroom was ok - no bath, but nice shower, but sadly only two towels for the three of us. Toilet is in such a small space it's actually hard to use... Breakfast was continental, and whilst I have no issue with the food on offer which was varied and tasty, the poor chaps running the clearing of tables and bringing out fresh plates to buffet were clueless. Cups running out, plates running out, glasses running out, trays running out - you name it. But their training seemed flawed - my wife asked for a coffee mug and he ran off to source one - but rather than bring a tray of mugs he just brought one - cue the next diner asking for a coffee mug and him doing the same, and then the same again. Logic defied this chap! Still - as I say - good price, bed was comfortable and as a base to sleep it's just fine. Just dont expect to relax in your room...",2018-04-13,ibis chateau-landon

Rooms were clean, decent and spacious during both spells. I appreciate the quiet atmosphere throughout the hotel despite it's close proximity to a major train stations.

tripadvisor,2 stars,There was no air conditioning when we arrived at this hotel in late May 2017. I was sweating every single night. The staff was not friendly. There might have been 1 nice person that helped us. The do not disturb signs on the doors are not acknowledged - the cleaning staff will just walk in your room when they are ready to clean. We stayed at this hotel after my boyfriend and I got engaged. We wanted to have another drink in the bar downstairs and the people couldn't change a keg when the beer tap ran out. The beer was hot and was all foam. It was quite surprising actually. Pros: the hotel is clean. The hotel is within walking distance from the Eurostar station that we took from London to Paris. There is a grocery store within walking distance and there is a subway transit station within walking distance as well. Cons: Not the best service but it is a great value.,2017-12-29,ibis chateau-landon

Where to even begin, No room what so ever within the hotel room and bathroom. My partner who is 6ft tall can‚Äôt even sit to use the toilet properly. The shower is hard to get into (if your elderly or find it hard to lift your legs high and step up forget it) oh and the vacuum style hair dryer burnt my hand it got so hot. Forget tea or coffee making facilities in your room. The walls are paper thin just like the bed mattress. Lifts also doggy. Flight Centre NEVER book this for any of your customers again.

tripadvisor,4 stars,"Ibis Paris Gare du Nord Chateau Landon is located close to the Gare du Nord and Gare de l'est train stations as well as the metro. The hotel offers baggage storage lockers for a fee if you arrive before your check-in time. The staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel is clean and quiet. The rooms have comfortable beds. The bathrooms are smaller, but there is still plenty of room to move around inside. The only downside to the hotel was that the Wi-fi was not very good. It was difficult to maintain connection in the room, and it was very slow. In the lobby, the Wi-fi did work better, but at times it was still difficult to bring up basic pages. There is a faster speed option available for a fee (that may be the reason why the free Wi-fi was not very good as an incentive to upgrade your connectivity). We only stayed a couple of days, so we did not upgrade to the higher speed service.

They are clean and decent and the bathroom had a lovely shower. The reception staff are polite and will help with any request for the best way to get to a destination. The breakfast was more than adequate with helpful staff. The French were happy to help with any directions especially on bus services. The area around the hotel is not the prettiest location but, the Pizzeria's just outside the hotel are reasonable and the food lovely. We used the Landon Metro Station just two minutes across the road. The only recommendation I would give is to bring your own hairdryer as the one in the bathroom is like using a hoover tool!! You can walk to the train station, it takes 5 minutes. We got a taxi to hotel on day one. The taxi rank is managed very efficiently.

Anyway Chateau Landon metro station is also only couple of minutes walk, 20 minutes and you're in the city center. My room was on the 5th floor. It looked very cosy, very clean, new and stylish. Breakfast was also very good. The only thing I was disappointed with - wifi quality. It was barely working in the evenings (i suppose due to the high traffic of users on late time). So, my advice would be to increase its power capacity. Also my room was without a fridge, so if you want to buy some french cheese for a present, better do it on the last day:).

We availed ourselves the breakfast buffet one morning, the choices were rather limited but were surprisingly filling. If you‚Äôre after location then you can‚Äôt go wrong with this property, especially if you want to save money (vs hotels in front of Gare du Nord) and catching a train at GdN.

There was no space to walk around the room. The bathroom was a good size with a shower. The location is good for a cheap visit to Paris, with gard du nord a 15 minute walk away and Louis blanc tube station 5 minutes away. As a couple this room would have been ok, but as a family it was far too small. The room was clean and well presented. The hotel does have underground parking which we used and was ‚Ç¨19 a night which is cheaper paying when you get there. The staff were friendly.

Overall a nice experience for a very affordable price considering the location, weekend booking, and compared to other hotel prices. PS Plenty of nice restaurants on Rue La Fayette. The only bad experience we had was in Le Chateau Landon next to Chateau Landon station, waited for a salad for an hour, while other [french-speaking] customers were getting their food within 10-20 min.

Via the pictuees on the website we used somehow expected a slightly larger room and found upon walking through the door, the room was rather compact. The only slight niggle that i had was the size of the shower, whilst i was rather upset to find the shower didnt look like it would accommodate two people i found it was a push to accomodate enough space for the one! This was a special big birthday weekend suprise for me with my partner but it was fit for purpose as a base which was central to everything. Lady at reception was extremely helpful with advice on where and where not to go. Lovely local bar, the Cristal Bar at the end of the road with a supermarket on the road behind the Ibis for emergencies. Overall, clean, warm and very good double glazing which kept out the noise of the busy road. Breakfast is continental based and of average price for the area. 10.50 ‚Ç¨, get there early as both times we used this facility most of the available food had been taken and not replenished.

When I complained at the front desk, the girl at the counter bluntly denied and told me that in France double bed means this. I was angry at that, and the manager stepped in and they found a proper double bed room. The check-in started with a big lie. The new room that I was provided was small, even the first room was really tiny. Everything is so close that if you are not careful then you will hit yourself with something. The bathroom was also small specially the toilet. It has a holder for the toilet paper and if you use the toilet, then it hits you. This would be very bad for bit fat people (no offense). The good thing is that the hotel is near the Gare du Est from where you can find all the connections to the city and tourist attractions. My advice is avoid the hotel if you can.

Well then the front desk clerk checking me said I am sorry but check in for the room is not till 12n. I said that is ok I can come back at 12n. I had also asked if there was a place to buy a adapter as I forgot mine and both front desk clerks had a lost look on the face and said no we don't know of any. So I return back at 12:05pm and waited in line to check in and as I waited I saw other people getting room keys and getting check in. When I got up to the front desk the front desk clerk(oceana) told me that my room is not ready and I had said I was told over 1 hour ago I can check in at 12n. So I asked her when my room would be ready and she said I don't know I cant give a time. I then asked if there are rooms ready I would any difference to another to get check in. The front desk clerk said we don't have anything to check and trying to get a simple answer was impossible. When I ask to speak to a Manager another lady came over and said it will be about 10 mins I said ok and waited in the small bar area. So I was waiting the rude front desk agent that would not give any answer walks by and then said oh it will be another 30mins and I asked on top of the 10 mins I was told then she proceeded to get offer drinks for another couple waiting for there room and never offered me anything. so Finally at 1pm was told by the rude front desk clerk we now have a room to check you in as I watch other check in after me. So the next day when checking out I had asked if I can leave my luggage for 1 hr in the luggage room like they did the day before and the front desk clerk I need to use a locker in the parking garage in a room that looks very unsafe and I ask what about the back room they put in yesterday behind the front counter and was told I can use the locker downstairs or take my luggage with me. Now on to the rooms portion the rooms itself was nice and beds were comfortable but the shower was weird as there was only a half glass and the when taking a shower the water flooded the bath room with water from the shower.

I didn't know what happened but it made me so worry as I had to leave very early in the morning. I prefer to stay in other area if I visit Paris again.",2017-05-03,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,4 stars,"Room was clean. But there is a smell, probably from carpet at all times in the entire floor( we stayed in level 6). No tea coffee making facilities in room. Location very good, easily accessible from train stations. Locers for luggage storage was available and good",2017-04-05,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,2 stars,"From the first day of stay every time we took a shower the bathroom flooded. You could tell that the carpet in the room was damp as there must have been an infiltration from the bathroom into the bedroom. We tried to explain this at the front desk, but they did not understand English well and did not solve our problem. We stayed five days at the hotel with this problem.",2017-03-29,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,4 stars,"A very practical, no frills, reasonably priced hotel. So close to Gard du Nord and practical for the airport and Parc du Exhibition. Breakfast is not included and it's cheaper to eat elsewhere but there is a bar for an evening drink, pay as you are served which is unusual for Paris and as a hotel resident. Bar snacks and room service available but I've not used them",2017-03-16,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,3 stars,"We came from Belgium and we wanted to find something fast and affordable online near Gare du Nord. Finding the hotel is very easy. The staff were sometimes 1 or 2 and couldn't accommodate fast when there is few buildup at check in time, nonetheless, they are friendly and great. We called to request for a fan because the AC is not working on the 3rd floor. They said would provide in 15-20 minutes, but provided for almost an hour. We already had a fan that time because there are a lot lying on our hotel floor (So I took the initiative to take it there). The good thing is in the evening and morning, the temperature was really nice. There are two lifts in this hotel and sadly only one is working and it took the time to reach each floor. So there are moments that we need to stand for 5 - 10 minutes for the lift to work. The breakfast was okay, good enough. The main goal was just to travel around in Paris by walking or by taking public transportation - so we aren't really looking for a fabulous hotel that we don't even plan to stay a long time. I can say that I was satisfied with this hotel because of the convenience, the price and the service were okay. Plus it was our first time in Paris. I wouldn't mind staying again at this hotel.",2017-03-05,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,3 stars,"The staff was fantastic. Super helpful, often helping us order food or reserve taxi's. They were very helpful in providing directions. The staff at breakfast was pleasant and the food was good...although not filling if you're used to an American style breakfast, but good options nonetheless. The hotel is in a convenient location to the Train station and nicely situated if you would like to take the nice stroll to Notre Dame. The walk was about 2 miles but the winding streets were beautiful side walks made the stroll feel safe and the shops along the way were nice. The room was updated, yet very small (to be expected in Europe) the shower was very nice. The only complaint is that it is located on a very busy very noisy street. The air conditioner in the room did not work well, so we had to leave the window open to feel a nice breeze, but it was difficult at times to sleep with all the car traffic and police and ambulance sirens going off. Overall it was worth it for the money.",2017-02-19,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,4 stars,"We arrived and were giving 2 card keys to the room, the room is nice, the bathroom was a good size, but we did have trouble with the shower door, the door is made of glass and only closes a certain distance in. When trying to close it more it feels like you are about to shatter the glass, once you use enough strength it will just about close, otherwise the floor becomes absolutely soaking. The room has a flat screen TV with football channels which was great when we got back to the room each night about 8:30 (Streets are safe but we didn't need to be out any longer) I know going on holiday isn't about watching football, but it was a nice added bonus. The bed was comfy and the maids were great, cleaning our room each day and giving us fresh towels. When checking out we were told there was a 72 euro charge on our stay, we were shocked and I asked what this was for, I was told for breakfast each day, the gentleman then went to say something along the lines of it doesn't matter if you have it or not (Not in a rude way) he then realised we booked through expedia so there was no charge, we would have refused to have paid it anyway and would have dealt with it through email. The area is ok, 45 minute walk to the Notre Dame, and the other way is about 45 to the eiffel tower, the eiffel tower was great but spoiled by the typical people selling things, one tried to grab my arm, they go up to you and try and tie a bit of string round your finger, then once its done you have no option of paying because they literally have you tied up! When I saw him trying to do this we walked off, we came back 10 minutes later and he tried doing it again, I said no once again then he tried to grab my arm which resulted in me saying ""I've already told you"" then he said ""Thank you"". Police were around so there wouldn't have been a problem, just so many of them. Police were everywhere, with pistols, shotguns and machine guns, made us feel a lot safer as we were worried initally when coming to Paris. Overall a good stay in a nice hotel, the French are rude when it comes to walking down the street, no thank you's for letting them past or sorry's when they barge into you. Be careful when crossing the street as the green man means nothing to some of the traffic, it's basically whoever is bravest to walk across the road first. I say its safe but we did see quite a lot of groups of men hanging about, but I think they were on the best behaviour due to the large amount of police they have there at the moment, at another time they may not be feeling as well behaved. We spent ¬£430 on 3 days in Paris, this included our return journey by Eurostar, so ¬£215 each was not bad at all. We enjoyed it, but would not go again, the meals out here are horrendously priced, when it comes to drinks order tap water, a can of coke in one place was 7 euros 50! The cheapest we found was 6 euros for a can, with 3 kids you would be spending almost 20 euros on a fizzy drink each. Notre Dame fantastic, Louvre an absolute must, get tickets before though as the line was very very long. Definitely come to Paris as it's something you should see in your life, we would come back to IBIS Hotel as we enjoyed our stay!",2017-02-16,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,5 stars,"Just returned from a weekend stay at this hotel. First things first, make sure you exit the MAIN entrance at Gare du Nord station - Rue Dunquerke (excuse the spelling). We left through the wrong exit so didn't start the weekend off very well. However, once we found the hotel it was great for our needs. Lovely, clean room although small and very compact. Beds changed and fresh towels every day. We only had one drink there and price was reasonable compared to when you get into the city centre (horrendously expensive and put a bit of a dampener on the weekend if I'm honest). Only booked breakfast for our last day and again, that was expensive for what you get (10.5 euros) - just remember it's a buffet breakfast so get your money's worth from the quite limited options. The staff were very friendly. The hotel itself is not in the greatest of areas but it's about a 10 minute walk from Gare du Nord station so location wise if you want to go off sight seeing etc, it's perfect. Easy to get around Paris once you understand the metro / train system and remember where you need to alight!! All in all, a lovely weekend, a fine hotel and would recommend.",2017-02-14,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,3 stars,The room and the bathroom were really tiny- which is OK considering you don't want to stay indoor through most of the day anyway! Reception staff was also really good. The manager went out of his way to go out and get a cab for me when I was leaving- which was really sweet. The only let down was that I had 50 euro stolen from my wallet by the cleaning lady. I accidentally left my wallet in my room during breakfast one morning and came back to her almost having finished cleaning the room. Counted the money and saw that a 50 was missing. Reported this to the reception but turns out that I would have to waste an entire day to go report this in the police station. I would recommend staying here for the location - but be very careful you have absolutely no money or anything valuable lying around when you're out- even by mistake!,2016-12-14,ibis chateau-landon

We could come by train from Airport in 30 minutes. This is an Indian locality so there were quite a few Indian food stores as well as Pure Veg. Restaurants nearby - Sarvana Bhavan and Krishna Bhavan. Ibis standard is visible in the hotel. Rooms are a bit small but clean with compact bathrooms and good wifi.

I already knew the location was good but I was also pleasantly surprised at the standard of accommodation. All the rooms were clean and fully functional. We had to swap one of the rooms because it smelt of smoke but they did this with no fuss. The showers are really good and two of the rooms looked like they had just be redecorated. With it being winter, it was good that the rooms were warm. The lift and other facilities worked well. The staff on the counter were friendly. We paid as we went for breakfast, but after paying silly money in the centre of Paris the first morning, we opted for breakfast at the hotel every time. It was cold buffet but was good value with plenty of choice and nice food. And finally, having a really good locker system for leaving suitcases on the final day was brilliant. A small fee but for ‚Ç¨5 we got bags for five people in one large locker... Btw try the Italian restaurant a two minute walk to the right hand side of the hotel as you look at it... Amazing!",2016-11-22,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,3 stars,"Look, this is not a luxury hotel but who goes to Paris to spend time in their hotel room? The rooms are small (most rooms in Paris are) but clean and it has WiFi. Location: It is centrally located between two main Metro stations, the bus line is on the same street as the hotel and it is not very far to catch a reasonably prices Uber to all the main touristy areas. There were many times I rode the Metro or caught the bus at night and felt safe. There are some restaurants very close in walking distance, open late night. Amenities: Breakfast is available for an additional price. There is a bar and it has food offerings as well. Some of the staff will assist you in the best way to get to a location but you have to ask. It has two elevators. At night, you have to be buzzed in by hotel staff so not anyone can just walk in. Areas of Opportunity: The bed consists of two beds pushed together and very thin mattresses so sleeping can be a bit uncomfortable. There are limited wall outlets to plug into. I had a room with a window and I could feel the wind blowing thru the window at nights, it was so cold. The room would not get hot enough to my liking but I admit I a cold-blooded so I am cold often. There is no bar soap only liquid soap so you will have to purchase some or bring your own if that is what you prefer. There are no washcloths, towels only. The internet connect is insanely slow. All the tv shows are in French even the subtitles for the American shows, lol. Do not expect a flat screen tv here. The floor is hard and feels like concrete under your feet despite a very thin layer of carpet. What that being said, this hotel is totally acceptable to stay and I would stay here again.

tripadvisor,3 stars,"The Ibis hotels within the Accor group are for the budget conscious. This hotel, located in the historic Chateau Landon section of the 10th arrondissement, was adequate for our five days in Paris however the upkeep of the building leaves a bit to be desired. If, like us, you don't have the means of accessing wifi don't expect their guest computer to be of any help. On arrival we tried to use this computer to contact family and it was not working, we were told it would be up and running soon. It did not operate in the 5 days were spent there. We had to approach the reception desk to ensure the housekeeping staff DIDN'T open the curtains to let in the hot afternoon sun, fortunately they provided a memo which was attached to said curtain for the duration. There is parking in the building but be aware that it is not cheap and access is a bit tricky since the driveway into the basement is very narrow. The breakfasts were good but on one day the meats and cheeses had to be removed since they were covered in flies. When they were returned covered later I wondered if it was the same flyblown food. The bar was not staffed for most of the time even though their own brochure, which was in the room, said bar service and light snacks would be available 24/7.

The bedrooms had recently been refurbished with a walk-in shower and had everything we needed for a short break in Paris. Breakfast was included and it was quite substantial with a machine to boil your own egg. North of Paris with the Louis Blanc Metro a 5 minute walk away. One line from there to get you into the centre of Paris - buy 10 tickets for Euros 14.20. The area in which the hotel was situated was not great but as long as we were back before it went dark we felt safe.

The rooms have been refurbished which is all nice except the new beds are very uncomfortable, the long dressing table under the window has gone and is replaced by a small table. The shelves and extra seat have gone. This all makes for a much less comfortable experience.

Small room, but it was comfortable, clean and a perfect base to come back to after long days of exploring the city. Awesome location being only a 10 minute walk from the Gare du Nord Train station with connections to virtually every metro line. The surrounding area seemed a little unsafe at night though - broken bottles, men urinating on the footpath, fight, emergency sirens at night etc. Never had an issue though. Breakfast was excellent! Lots of variety of to appease the cuisine of different cultures, and most importantly, there was always an abundance of French pastries. If the hotel was in a nicer neighbourhood I would definitely stay here again as it was very economical and met all of our needs on our short stay in Paris.",2016-04-02,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,4 stars,"We stayed here for 1 night. The check-in staff were very good. We were on the 4th floor which was obviously being refurbished and there was a very strong smell of paint. Various things in our room hadn't quite been finished off properly. Plug in the bath didn't work properly, lights not wired up correctly to switch off from the bed and some things simply looked unfinished. Our room too smelled strongly of paint so we left the window open as much as possible. I later noticed a sign by the lift (in French only) apologising for any nuisance caused by the refurbishments. I felt that guests should have been told about the refurbishments when they checked in with a personal apology. I did tell the reception staff about the problems with our room but as we were there for only one night, I didn't want to be bothered with people trying to sort it out for us (and there's no way to get rid of the paint smell except to keep the room ventilated). We stayed for breakfast and it was excellent. The food was fresh and supplies were continually replenished and staff were friendly and polite. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others but they were not quite on top of the refurbishments. Our room was very nicely decorated and the bed and pillow were very comfortable.

tripadvisor,4 stars,"I was looking for basic accommodations for one night in Paris, near the Gare du Nord, and having had satisfactory experience with the Ibis brand in the past, chose this hotel. It was a good choice and provided everything that I needed. Check-in and check-out were both handled pleasantly and efficiently by an English speaking staff member. The room was small and somewhat spartan - as is typical of Ibis and of budget European hotels - but very clean. The two single beds were aligned very close together - I mention this only because the close proximity could bother some who perfer to have more space around them when they are sleeping. There is a small ledge that provides a marginally adequate work space, an en-suite loo with a shower, sink, and toilet, and climate control can be adjusted from within the room. The beds apparently had the new verion of the mattresses that Ibis uses, and I found it surprisingly comfortable - no problem getting an excellent night's sleep. There is no kettle for making coffee or tea, but tea/coffee is available downstairs at a small cost. I booked this hotel using their prepaid ""winter special"" rate through the brand web site, and it was an excellent deal compared to other hotels in the area. I usually look for simple, basic accommodations when traveling - ones that are clean, safe, and well managed - and this property was a very good match. WiFi is available, but I didn't use it and do not remember if it's free or paid. I would definitely return on subsequent visits to Paris.",2016-01-27,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,4 stars,"Having established precisely which of the five Ibis hotels in the area we were staying at we got settled in. We arrived at 10am just off the Eurostar and were able to check in early for no extra cost and have a much needed rest before heading into the city. Just a short walk from the Gare du Nord and Chateau Landon underground it was so easy to get everywhere. It was nice being away from the main tourist buzz further in the city and the hotel was quiet. The hotel itself was lovely, could have done with a few more plug sockets and the bathroom was a bit smelly after it was cleaned each day but leaving the fan on and perhaps opening the window a touch solved this. Staff were very helpful and friendly and the ability to leave your bags in a locker for the day before getting the Eurostar home was very practical. Would stay again if coming back to Paris.",2016-01-17,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,1 stars,"I contemplated posting this review, but after the way the hotel handled the following situation and I also want to prevent this to happen to anyone else, I've decided to post. This hotel plays a major role in why I am not keen to return to Paris any time soon. The hotel is in the 10th arrondissement, not a very safe neighbourhood in Paris. It is not close enough to central Paris for attractions as you have to make the journey on the metro - be aware of pickpockets. What really ruined the hotel for me was that I was harrassed by the receptionist. He repeatedly called my room asking if I wanted to go out with him/have a drink/saying he wanted to see me. Scaring me so much that I unplugged the phone. When in the lobby he called me pretty and offered to be my boyfriend in Paris and asked a lot of personal questions. I lodged a complaint and then a woman who works there (I dont even know if shes the manager) asked me to tell her my story. She was disgusted and told me he wont be there when I'm there. Whether he lost is job or not I dont know. I was then moved 2 rooms down from my old room. No upgrade, no formal apology, no refund, nothing. It was not financially possible for me to leave so I had to stay, still afraid that he would find me. As for the room itself, it was never cleaned just tidied, towels hung up bed made etc. The shower drain in both rooms smelled vile. I paid ‚Ç¨11 for food from the bar that was heated up in the microwave and god knows how old. I was across from a staff stairwell and was repeatedly woken up by the door slamming when careless staff members entered in and out. I will never ever come back here and if you are looking for a reason to not stay here, PLEASE let this be it.",2016-01-13,ibis chateau-landon

I ask wake up call for everyday by in-room tel or at reception, but there is 1 hour late in the first morning during my stay AND there will NO wake up call during my rest of the day. You have to know I live there for 5-nights. This is very basic hotel service for hotel customer, right? 2. During my stay, I did ask the reception staff I DO NOT need Clean-up service & I have put the ""Do not Disturb"" paper tap on the door lock. But one day, there is a room cleaning service without my permit, my thing is moving (of course it seems like nothing is lost). But the attitude of the reception staff is response so bad and not appropriate... I forgot the name but the staff of lady who is on duty at night. As you have to know this hotel of staff is always changing (on roster), if you ask something to the reception staff today and the next day you have to repeat or argue what we have concerned. 3. Before travelling to France, I have asked for any hot water provided from hotel especially in morning time. In the email, they are welcoming me to get hot water from Bar during my stay. But every time they have many query and the behavior is so bad for me. Totally, the attitude / service of this hotel is feeling uncomfortable and not really helpful compared to the same ibis hotel where I stayed in Strasbourg for the same trip.

tripadvisor,1 stars,"In the past 8 years, we regularly travel to Paris at least once a year and stay at this hotel. Everything is getting worse with the time until now that we make a decision not to stay here anymore in the future. Why? Let's us share you our experience. Check-in - We are in their loyalty program. The good thing is that we got some small discount. So, we would give as positive. - Ibis has online check-in function, which is claimed that once you arrive to the hotel, the key will be ready to be picked up. You can choose the time-slot that you will arrive there before noon (before the official check-in time). In reality, the key was not ready as claimed. This online check-in is just to save our time to fill in a form at the front desk. That's it. We still need to wait till the official check-in time (12h00). - Staffs at the front desk --> most of the time, there was only one person to take care of literally everything. We were there to pick up our key later but the staff was on the phone and did not seem to try to end the conversation or did not even tell us politely to wait for a moment. He just kept talking on and on and on and let us waiting in front of his very eyes. Friendliness of the staffs...well, not quite visible. Additionally, the staff did not inform us anything about our room, our bill (which was prepaid already), the breakfast and so on. Luggage room - The staff at front-desk informed us confusingly that we just have to take the elevator to the luggage room in the cellar. So, we followed his instruction by taking the elevator and go down there. - In the cellar, you have to walk through their path way along with metal carts of dirty laundry with all the bed sheet, towels waiting to be picked up until you reach the door with luggage sign on it. - Finally, the luggage room......surprise surprise!! It is automatic machine, which accepts only coins....not credit card, not debit card and not even bank notes. The price range is from 3 to 7 Euro (or something like that, I cannot remember it anymore). - Then, we have to go up to the front desk to get some coins. And once we try to put in, the machine wants to have exact amount of money. I guess, it will not give change and that was why we need the exact amount to put in. - All in all, this is the first hotel ever for us, where we have to pay for luggage storage. Room and facility - Very tiny but we can cope with it since this is Paris. It is normal for that. - We have only one small window in the room with bad lighting. Their try-to-be stylish lamp does not look good though. - Bathroom --> the shower area is very tiny, especially when you close the shower curtain. It feels literally like there was no room to move at all. - Toilet --> Lack of toilet brush - TV channels --> good choices with international channels. - Cleanliness --> pretty good!! - The next day, our key card does not work anymore and we have to go again to the front desk to get a new card. And yes, the nightmare at the front desk, long queue with lack of staffs Check-out - The same thing --> one staff on the phone and continuously talking bla bla bla. Later on, she started to realize that it was not ok for us anymore. Then she became multi-tasking - on the phone and checking out for us. No saying goodbye or wishing us to have a nice day or anything (because, of course, she was still on the phone!!) Therefore, no more stay at this hotel in the future!!!",2015-10-09,ibis chateau-landon

The room also was fine except that in Paris Ibis do not provide tea making facilities or even a power point to charge phones, ipads etc. I thought that expecting a guest to fork out money to charge phones was extremely mean spirited and disappointing. Also the breakfast was pretty ordinary with the only hot food being an egg that you could boil for yourself. Personally I would not bother again. Also the shower soap is dispensed from a squeeze bottle attached to the wall and unfortunately the responsible staff member did not bother to snip off the top of the lid making it necessary for reception to arrange someone to come and do it for me.

tripadvisor,5 stars,"I booked this hotel based on its proximity to Gare du Nord train station. I was slightly nervous about my stay here after reading the reviews however I have no complaints at all. I stayed here for 3 nights at the end of July. Based on the fact that this is a 3 star hotel in Paris city centre, I was more than happy with what I got for ¬£50 odd a night. I have honestly had less quality for the money in a British seaside resort. The room was small yes, but I was planning on spending more time sight-seeing than in my room, so that didn't bother me. It was clean, with a comfy bed, a warm and powerful shower with shower gel/shampoo, and a hair dryer which was all I needed from my room. It even had a telly (albeit with only 1 or 2 English speaking channels). The room was warm in the night like other people have mentioned on here but once we turned on the air-con, we found it more comfortable. I didn't book the all-you-can-eat Continental breakfast but decided to pay ‚Ç¨10.50 each day there when i realised that the local cafe/restaurant breakfast was on average ‚Ç¨9 for just a coffee, juice and croissant. There breakfast was nice enough. There was croissants, pain au chocolats, cereals, breads, cold meats, cheese, and jams. There is a restaurant in the hotel but we didn't use it as we had food wherever we ended up in the city each night. We did have drinks in a few of the restaurants around the hotel and there were no problems with any of them. The hotel had free Wi-Fi and my phone did detect it but it couldn't connect. It didn't bother me as I didn't need Wi-Fi, but if I did need to use the internet, I would have had to look at other options there. There are several metro stations within a 5 minute walk which is brilliant for cheap and easy transport. You can vary which station you use depending on where you need to go and which station has the most direct line there; I'd recommend printing a metro map in colour before you go - Godsend! Gare du Nord is convenient too as the direct train is only ‚Ç¨10 each way from airport. Cheaper than standard bus transfers! All in all, if you want a cheap, clean and convenient city centre hotel, this is perfect. It is not luxury, but that reflects the price. I would definitely stay here again.",2015-08-01,ibis chateau-landon

About the breakfest, it's expensive for what is served, (10 euros) and not a great variety. But the problems really began during the first night when we noticed the air conditioning was not working properly. (and by the comments I'm not the only one to mention this). It was not cool enough, and even if it was not that hot in the room, we started to feel uncomfortable in the following nights. I complained in the reception and the staff faked a surprise and didn't really care about, since I told him to send someone to fix it (he agreed) and I waited until the last day for nothing. At last, unlike everywhere else I had stayed before, if you want to leave your luggage for the day, you have to pay 3 euros for it.

They don't provide any luggage storage facilities - well, if you pay 3-7‚Ç¨. Free luggage storage is something we travelers take for granted but nonetheless, that set off our impression on the hotel. And we found out the hard way that air conditioning is not working - when we tried taking a break from the Paris summer mid day sun. When I went to complain to the reception, the staff acted surprised and told me that if I just checked-in, I can't expect the room to be cold. I told him that we have been in the room for the 3 hours and it was still hot and stuffy. He asked me to go try another room to see if it is working and issued me a new room card. I had to go up the room and check it myself - as the staff clearly told me that he was too busy to check. And the room wasn't working, so I went down to ask again. He refused to serve me and asked his colleague to face me instead. Only then, I was told that air conditioning is not working for the entire hotel and we had to bear with it - with everyone else, without any sense of apology. So, I asked what they can do - they issued me a table fan to cool ourselves down and that's all they can do.

We were sent to the wrong room type twice, processed in a slow manner and pressured to buy the breakfast even though we declined multiple times. The room was small. But that is Paris. The main issue is the bed stunk of old cigarette smoke. Clean sheets do no cover up years of suspected cigarette smells. The bed is also just a foam mattress placed on top of a hard base. Think a cheap ikea foam bed. It would slide off during the night. Cheap and not what you would expect from a hotel. The air conditioning was nothing more than a low powered fan. No cooling power at all. Common in the property I hear. Traffic noise outside meant either stay in a quit hot sweaty stinky room or enjoy the extremely loud traffic outside. Wifi is free but almost unusable. Paid wifi is available but I found no way to change the plan once it was selected. Finally the girl manning the bar was rude to us. Angry in tone. Uncalled for.

I was most unhappy about several aspects of my visit. The reception staff were surly and unwelcoming.

tripadvisor,3 stars,"Initially placed in a smoking room when I'd specifically reserved non-smoking, I was told I would have to spend my first night in there as I had ""used the bathroom"" before asking to change. On the plus side, the staff did organise to change the room for me for my second night. I was also unfortunate enough to be in the hotel during the time they selected to shut down the air conditioning for maintenance. I would have thought that this was a task more suited to the autumn/winter months rather than in June, particularly when your hotel is fully booked up. As it was a planned event and of at least 1 week's duration, a thoughtful touch would have been to place fans in all the rooms, rather than wait to be asked. The rooms, though small, are clean and the bed comfortable so its reasonable providing you only need a place to sleep and wash.",2015-06-26,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,3 stars,"We stayed for two nights at the hotel, it's a convinient location as we travelled with Eurostar. It's quite average.. quite old and small rooms, but ok for the money. The only thing that REALLY bothered us was the fact that it got really stuffy during warm days/nights. The A/C in the room is simply medieval, it worked all night long and there weren't any changes in the temperature. We had to open the window to let some fresh air in, but it was quite noisy outside so we did not have a really good sleep. We did not have breakfast at the hotel as I always find them a rip off and not at all enjoyable. After you check out you can leave your bags in the hotel's baggae room, they have lockers and you have to pay approx 3 Euros for up to 24hrs for a medium locker (which fits two hand sized luggages)",2015-06-14,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,3 stars,"This hotel is 200 meters away from Metro Louis Blanc and Chateau Landon. Gare de l'Est and Gare du Nord are 10 minutes by walk from this property. Metro station Stalingrad is also 10 minute walk. The room and reception area has wifi. However if your smartphone has only chrome browser then it will be a challenge to connect to free wifi offered by hotel. Remedy is to download any other browser before checking in the hotel. The room is compact with double bed with side table stand on either sides. A very small shelf serves as wardrobe. The room heater was very good and we always felt nice and warm once we checked in the room, especially after the stroll in the colder evenings. The room feels little damp. A generous serving of room fragrance will really help. One nice design feature in the bathroom is provision of a recess in the floor area, from which the water drains quite slowly. I noticed it serves two purpose: Keeps the feet drenched in warm water even after bath and secondly it conserves water by limiting the time of bath. After some time of bath, the recess gets filled with water and starts overflowing to the proximity of the room. Not sure if this design feature was intentional but i liked fact that it helped conserve water. The wash basin is provided with hair dryer. The breakfast menu was so boring. The staff in the breakfast counter also not friendly. This is one point that will make me think about checking in this hotel again. However the staff at reception are friendly and give local suggestions. The hotel has automatic luggage storage cabinets. You could hire smaller, medium and large cabinets for 3, 5 and 10 euros as coins respectively.

The rooms are small, but aren't all rooms in Paris small? It is still liveable. The free WIFI is always a great touch! Great stay at this hotel, we really enjoyed our time! A small tip: There are SO many Ibis Hotels in Paris, especially in this region, double check which one you have booked at, as we had trouble finding the correct one thanks to our travel agent.

The staff were friendly, the rooms are a good size and clean, although it looks about time for some redecoration. Breakfast was pretty good too. Our previous experience of the chain was an Ibis Styles - I have to say the Breakfast here was better, but we were quite disappointed that later in the day we had to pay 2euro50 for a cup of tea and there are no drink-making facilities in the room (this is where I point out that drinks are free at Ibis Styles...). Whether you like the bed or not is down to personal preference, but we found the pillows to be far too soft. The only English TV channel offered is BBC World, but there is a USB connection which comes in handy for watching your own movies/TV shows, etc. We were out in the area for dinner at night and felt quite safe, although I wouldn't recommend being in the area of Gare du Nord at night.",2015-03-15,ibis chateau-landon

It is not at Gare du Nord, but on the northern end of the rails leading to Gare de l'Est, a good 20 min walk with luggage. The room obviously used to be a smoking room and was so sprayed full of room spray that I could hardly breath. Although I opened the window for a good half hour (at temperatures outside at about freezing), it was still so strong that it woke me up during the night and I had to air the room again. There were lots of little faults like damaged cladding, leaking shower door which resulted in flooded bathroom etc. The towels were so think they had obviously been washed to near extinction. The breakfast room had all the charm of a school cantine. Overall I have stayed in many Youth Hostels which were in better nick.

I'm the kind of traveler who needs his eggs and sausages and bacon for breakfast - but here, none of that is available. In fact, there were no hot foods as part of the buffet, except for the coffee. And in a Parisian Winter, one would like hot food! The other thing is, the Hotel itself is pretty far away from most places and unless you use the metro, the central part of the city is about 20-30 minutes away.

It's less than a 10-minute walk from the Gare du Nord station, across a bridge, where a train on RER B takes 35 minutes to get to the airport. Make sure you go to the right Ibis! The place is a cut above the typical budget hotel. It's modern and comfortable (though my room was tiny). A big plus is the excellent breakfast - lots of choice and good quality. The number of people from the Indian sub-continent staying at the hotel made me suspect that there must be some good Indian restaurants in the area.There are!

tripadvisor,5 stars,"I think it's important to clear up some confusion (like I experienced initially). There are 2 Ibis Hotels close to Gare du Nord. One is right by the station and one is across the bridge from the station. This page is for the latter. My wife and I stayed here from 01/12-07/12 and I was really happy with everything. From the service, to the size of the rooms, to the breakfast. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom is big enough for essentials. There is no place for bags in the rooms but you may store them on a lower level of the hotel. Breakfast might seem a bit limited as the same food is served everyday, but the quality is great. The only issue we had was with the available seating space. But you can enjoy breakfast from early till around 12, so you're sure to find a gap. It is located close to Gare du Nord, be we ended up using the metro at Louis Blanc more, since it is a lot closer than the bigger station and a lot less busy. I would definitely recommend this to all and would stay here again whenever we return to Paris.",2014-12-06,ibis chateau-landon

Other receptionist has made 7 mistakes while rewriting company details from my card! The room itself was a just fine, with no extras though. Bathroom however was a total disaster. Hinge of the shower door was broken so I had to lift the whole door to close them. Mirror was well worn with several grey patches at the bottom. Flush in the toilet was not working properly either. It required several presses to flush the water. But the worst thing of them all was standing water in the shower! Hotel was offering free WiFi which was extremely slow. If you wanted better performance you had to pay for premium connection. The selection of food for the breakfast was very poor. Hotel claims to step up to premium standards and is willing to compensate for issues. When I was checking out on the next day I have made a verbal complaint.

Our room, on the other hand, was very small, even for 2 tiny ladies with minimal luggage; just as well we were related! The room was stuffy, too, but we were unable to leave the large window open overnight due to loud street noise. The room & bathroom were kept clean, but the towels, originally white, were now shades of grey and so very thin they required changing every day, an environmental extravagance we try to avoid.

Check in was smooth and I was assigned a room on the 4th or 5th floor (I don't remember exactly). I opened the door and saw the ugliest room I've ever seen in my entire life. I didn't look like a 3 star room. Not even a hostel room. I had requested a double bed and got two single beds. The room was tiny even with only two single beds. I went to the reception and asked if they had a double bed. I had to wait 10 minutes and got a new room. This one on the second floor. It was better than the first room but still the worst room I've ever stayed in. I was considering booking another room at a different hotel but it was very expensive because it was last minute and I would've lost the money I paid for 4 nights at this Ibis ""hotel"". I decided to stay and here's what I have to say: I didn't have a wall adapter and asked if they had one. Of course they did but I had to give them a 20 Euro deposit which was ridiculous (Never had to leave a deposit at the other 4 hotels I stayed during my trip). The guy who was very rude printed a receipt for the record but he didn't give me a copy (I thought I didn't need one). When I checked out and gave the adapter back, they didn't want to give me my deposit back. They said that there was no record of my deposit. Finally after some time they found the record and gave me my deposit back. The room: It was very small. The bed was soft and surprisingly comfy (only positive thing about the hotel and the room).There were two visible dried blood stains on the wall below the window. That would be the first thing you'd see when entering the room. There were also smoke stains on the wall around the ventilation system. The bathroom was too small. The shower wasn't big enough for me (I'm 5'7 weighing 140lb). I would hit the walls and the shower knobs with my elbows. The hot water would get freezing cold suddenly and then hot again constantly for some reason. We had to use a towel every time we showered because the water from the shower leaked onto the bathroom floor. There was mold all over the ceiling. The panel below the bathroom window had yellow stains (see picture). The staff: They were rude for the most part and were not customer oriented. The cleaning staff were the worst. Our room didn't have the ""do not disturb"" sign you hang on the door. I don't think any room had it. I didn't see one anywhere. The cleaning lady would knock on the door around 10am when we were sleeping (we were jet lagged). We wouldn't open the door and she would leave. Everything is fine to this point. Then, a couple of minutes later, she would try again for a longer period of time, and then again. We even got a phone call from the reception!! Come on!! The cleaning lady would try until I had to open the door and let her know that I didn't need her to clean the room. That happened every day. Location: The area is very sketchy. All the attractions are far if you're planning to walk. If you do so, be prepared to walk through some bad neighbourhoods. In conclusion, this has been the worst experience I've ever had with a hotel (I thought I had my worst experience when I went to L.A.). I will never consider Ibis or any of its hotels for my future stays anywhere in the world. I would've spent more money if I had known how bad this hotel was. Money wasn't an issue but I decided to book this hotel after researching hotels and reviews because in my opinion Paris is overrated and hotels in Paris are overpriced. Hotel star rating in Europe, Paris in this specific case, is definitely not the same as in North America. Spend a little more money and find a better hotel. I DO NOT recommend this hotel!!! Nor does my partner!",2014-06-15,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,4 stars,"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in late May. The hotel staff were very pleasant, and spoke excellent English. The hotel is just a few minutes walk from the Gare Du Nord railway station for Eurostar and CDG airport, making it an ideaql location. it is also just 100 metres from the nearest metro station which is then just a few stops from the ""attractions"" of Paris. The location couldn't have been better and is quiet too. The rooms are fairly spacious for a city centre hotel, and are cleaned daily. We decided against choosing the breakfast buffet option, after all, we were in PARIS! Eat out! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a few nights in a beautiful city",2014-06-14,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,4 stars,The hotel is located just five minutes away from Gare du Nord and therefore ideal for travellers using Eurostar or Thalys train services.

tripadvisor,2 stars,"I have booked this hotel 8 months before my visit to Paris, maybe with a lowest price (90 EUR/night for a double room w/o breakfast), but at the end I would say the price/performance ratio was one the worst, between the hotels that I've visited so far. Location not bad, near to Gare du Nord, which from there you can take the RER B to the CDG airport, and near to Gare del Est, which has also a very good connection with the Paris metro. Maybe we got one of the worst room in the hotel (room number 104, avoid to stay here!!!), where we were woken up already at 07:30 am because of the noise coming from the breakfast room just beneath the room. And then at 08:30 you hear the cleaning ladies talking and shouting! with eachother while cleaning the rooms starting with the 1.floor. Personnel at the reception was mediocre, the check-in took maybe more than 20 minutes, thanks god I had a prinout from booking.com with me, because the staff said that there is no reservation at all! The another thing was that there were only two towels in the room altough we were in a double room, it should be normally the big towels and two small towels, so everyday I needed to go the reception and to beg for 2 more towels!! Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this hotel, by the way, if you think that the hotel is close to the train stations, you could leave your baggage there after check-out and could have a last chance to visit the city, then you have to take into consideration that there is luggage room on the -1 floor, where you have to pay between 2,50-5,00 EUR depending on the size of your luggage, which is normally at most of the hotels for free !!!",2014-05-24,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,4 stars,A basic Ibis hotel near the gare du nord ( 500 metres). A lot cheaper than many hotels in the area. The reception staff are very good at check-in and if they have a room free before the 12pm check in time they will give it to you-so a great bonus there. Basic rooms and can be a bit noisy at night-but you don't spend much time in your hotel in Paris do you?,2014-05-05,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,4 stars,We got to paris earlier than we were able to check in so we thought we'd go to the hotel to see if they had an area for our luggage. They let us check in 2 and a half hours early with no charge which I was very happy about. The room was pretty good...the only negative I have about the room is that you can hear everything that is going on outside but we managed to sleep just fine.

Croissants for breakfast could be just baked but the next day you can get the same croissants, which are almost ready to kill someone as boomerang. For today's breakfast there are could be a lot of different things (crepes, yoghurts, cheeses, hams, fruits and so on), but for tomorrow's there will be no cheeses or fruits or something else.

tripadvisor,4 stars,"Spent 3 nights at the Ibis Paris Gare du Nord Chateau Landon for a long weekend incorporating the rugby - which England lost!! Fortunately that was the only disappointment. This good value hotel was a great base, 5 minutes from the station and various transport links which get you around Paris with ease. It was clean and comfortable and provided a very good breakfast. Although on the small side the rooms were fine with a damn good shower! Could do with a safe, tea/coffee making facilities and some coat hooks in the room, but apart from that it served its purpose very well. On the downside - the staff! Miserable as sin and very unhelpful with some having a very poor attitude - in particular the staff managing breakfast, a dreadful bunch! There was one exception however, and that was Chekhov, the receptionist. What a top guy, very friendly and very helpful. He now sports an England rugby scarf. He could teach his colleagues a thing or two about customer service!

The second time we stayed for three nights. The check in staff was not aware of the email from the hotel after our first feedback. Being late in the night (11pm), he said it was too late and he could only give us a room on the first floor; we had requested for a room on the higher floor as you can hear people talking in the street. Then the night manager came around and gave us a room on the third floor. There was no vending machine or coffee shop - because we asked if there is anywhere to go get a cup of hot chocolate, he offered to make us a cup - we are very thankful for that! the next day we found late in the night that the only drinks vending machine was not working - the reception staff told us we could get a bottle in the bar, which would of course cost more!

tripadvisor,2 stars,"The worst experience of my first Europe trip. Me and my girl friend traveled to Paris from London. It was warm (around 26-28 degree Celsius) and the room wasn't air-conditioned. The staff had a hard time telling us that it was controlled by the government so ok I had to accept it. To be fair we got a table fan to use. The room was facing the main road on the first floor and it was quite noisy even during the night. The breakfast was terrible and we cancelled the breakfast package for the rest of the days. The most terrible experience on top of the above-mentioned, was with the waitress serving the breakfast buffet. I accidentally spilled out some corn flakes (I swear it wasn't my fault as I just turned the grind handler slightly, the corn flakes flowed out and spilt, but it wasn't a mess really) The waitress came to me, threw the plates in frustration right beside me and stared at me in anger.

tripadvisor,4 stars,I stayed at this hotel a couple of weeks ago at the start of a trip to Germany. I arrived at Paris Gare du Nord station by Eurostar and was traveling on the following morning to Stuttgart by train service departing from the Gare d'Le Est. Therefore the location of this hotel being just a few minutes walk from each station meant it was extremely convenient. All in all I can say this hotel is exactly as you would expect from the Ibis chain. My room was clean and presentable but certainly compact. It was absolutely fine for a one night stay as a temporary halt during a traveling trip but I wouldn't want to stay in such a room for any extended length of time. The bed was comfortable and bathroom facilities were all good. I actually had a rather nice view from the window in my room looking back down the road I had walked up from the Gare du Nord and if I craned my head round to the right I could actually see just the top of the Sacre Coeur in the distance. I didn't use much of the facilities of the hotel. In the evening I sat down in the foyer and had a beer purchased from the bar and used the wi-fi facility which worked fine. They do offer a breakfast but as I was due to catch an early train I did not have time to avail myself of this. So all in all a good ‚Äútravelers‚Äù hotel but not one to stay put in for any great length of time.,2013-10-22,ibis chateau-landon

The air conditioner wasn't great, but my roommate and I opened the window and let in the fresh air at night so the air conditioner wasn't an issue for us. Continental breakfast was DELICIOUS. The location wasn't ideal if you are looking to be in the heart of the city, but like I said, we were barely in the hotel so the distant location did not matter. It was located on a Metro station that contained a line that connected us to pretty much all the other major lines we needed. I would stay here a dozen times over.",2013-10-07,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,2 stars,"I have stayed at this hotel several times, but the latest from 12-16 September was very disappointing. My room (701) is a single room, but really it is only a cupboard at the end of the corridor which is just big enough for a single bed. It had the basic comforts, but was nowhere near the standard I have experienced in the past. On one day (a Saturday) I arrived back in the evening to find that the room had not been cleaned. I am finding that this is happening more often in Paris hotels. The breakfasts were standard Ibis buffet, but could have done with a bit of imagination to inject some local flavour. The croissants were particularly poor - small and soggy specimens. Would it not be possible to warm them in an oven for a few minutes to breathe some life back into them? If I stay here again I will not be taking their breakfast. There is a bar nearby which supplies much better croissants and coffee at a fraction of the cost. In the past I have been satisfied at this hotel, but this time I was very disappointed.",2013-09-19,ibis chateau-landon

Also, we had drain problems as mentioned in another reviewers comments. You couldn't leave the water running while you had your shower, or the base would have overflowed.

There was a heater hanging off the wall, and the was not even connected to the wall, just one big screw hanging loose. The room so hot you have to put the air conditioning on, which sounds like a diesel engine continuous noise. So do not expect much sleep, as for breakfast, waste of time.

tripadvisor,3 stars,"I stayed two nights at the Ibis Paris Gare du Nord Chateau Landon. My room was extremely small with one small twin bed that I almost fell out of when rolling over. The shower has no curtain so the whole bathroom gets wet when you shower. The first night (a Saturday night) resulted in loud noise in the morning as the maids had great debates with each other in the hall at 8 a.m. - surely they should expect that some guests want to sleep in on a Sunday morning. I had to call the front desk to complain about their noise. In addition, there were strange bumping/dropping sounds from above the room that occurred a lot. The breakfast was not well displayed, there were no eggs (as other Ibis have) and it just seemed dirty and unappealing. I skipped breaksfast the second day and had a protein bar instead (and that was quite an improvement). The front desk staff, though, were extremely friendly and helpful - they were the highlight of the stay. The location is good for access to the trains but the general area is not that nice - this is a tradeoff you will have to make if you need quick access to Gare du Nord or Gare de l'Est.

The rooms are pretty small and overall service is OK. I am still awaiting my 20 euros that they promised they would return. One of their staff members charged me 40 Euros for adapter and while checking out I was informed its only 20 Euros. The breakfast is good though and the surrounding area has many good places to eat.,2013-06-17,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,4 stars,We chose the hotel as it was near the Gare du Nord but If we visit Paris again we may stay nearer the center. The hotel was clean and tidy and the staff very helpful. One of the 2 bedrooms waa a bit cramped but the other was fine. It was only 5 minutes walk to the Metro from where you could go anywhere in Paris for 1Euro 60cents and all the 'must visit' places could be reached in less than 30 minutes. Beware of Pick Pockets in the area (we had a purse stolen in Gare du Nord) and take your bank details with you in case you suffer the same fete and have to telephone your bank to cancel your credit / debit cards.,2013-06-17,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,3 stars,"I stayed at this Ibis hotel with a large group. Normally I find the Ibis hotels all much the same with some offering better service than others. This was a poor stay. Do not select rooms over the entrance on the lower floors. The traffic noise is such that you cannot open the window. My next room had a blocked shower drain which was very unpleasant. There was little in the way of an apology when I changed rooms for the second time. On a plus side it is central to the Gare du Nord, the breakfast is fine and there is free WIFI throughout.",2013-06-16,ibis chateau-landon

Wardrobe and storage space poor. Noise from neighbouring rooms was a real problem. Beds were fairly comfortable but the decor and carpets looked a little tired. On the whole it didnt matter too much because we had a busy schedule around the city and didnt intend to spend that much time in the hotel over the 3 nights.

Gare de L'Est and Gare du Nord train stations are both within easy walking distance, as is Chateau Landon Metro station. We would definitely stay there again. It is worth making an online advance booking as we made a significant saving that way.",2013-04-18,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,4 stars,"This hotel is very convenient for the metro straight into the heart of Paris in about 10 minutes. We found the hotel very clean and everything was fine in the room. The linen was clean and the bed comfortable. You could be in any one of the Ibis hotels as they are all basically the same layout. There is a lift and they also have rooms on one floor where smokers can stay. The breakfast is good value and there was plenty of choice. It was a buffet and was being constantly being refilled when items run out. The lounge area is very small and the restaurant/bar is even smaller. This is where we ran into difficulties. The snack menu was exactly the same as the Ibis we had been staying at in Amiens prior to Paris, so not much choice. Not a huge problem, just annoying. In the evening we wanted to eat in as we had been out all day. Restaurant not fully open, just doing a reduced menu. It wasn't stated whether it was just that weekend or every weekend. No chef. We chose what was supposed to be succulent chicken breasts and haricot beans. We asked for fries instead of beans, but was told we couldn't. What we got was not breasts as they were on a bone. They were dry, cooked in a microwave, and no sauce. The rest of the plate was full of soggy tinned haricot beans, and I mean FULL. It wasn't the waitresses fault, she had to cook and serve as well. After all this we were charged an astronomical price. If it had been a good meal then there would have not been a problem with the charge. We complained when we arrived home and had a very quick reply. We had a very nice apology saying that the catering department were putting new procedures in place, to make sure this kind of situation did not arise again. They also offered us the money back for the meal and drinks. It took the hotel about three weeks to forward the cheque, after an email reminder. So in conclusion, a good, clean, convenient hotel, but avoid eating there in the evenings if you can.",2013-04-09,ibis chateau-landon

The breakfast was good with lots of choice - pastries, cereals, fruit, cheese, ham, bread etc. The small bar/bistro area served a limited selection of dishes, but there are other eateries in the area if you want to go out to eat.

There were ceiling tiles missing, which sort of evened out the manky curtain (singular). The TV had only one English channel (BBC News) but that was set at an impossibly low volume (funny that??) where all the others were fine. The hotel is set in something akin to the Helmund Province, and I would not like to have walked around there on my own.

However, the only English TV channel (BBC) has its volume locked so that it is barely audible. The hotel could do nothing to improve the situation and blamed the problem on the BBC. I disagree. The message on the television says that the Ibis chain has determined the setting. No one has addressed or called an administrative office to let them know it is not functioning. My other complaint was the condition of the fruit at breakfast. A pear was mushy with flies eminating from it. The other fruit was damaged and not very presentable.

tripadvisor,3 stars,"My husband & I spent three nights at the Ibis from 28 Sept ‚Äì 01 Oct 12, & it was an average stay. We deliberately chose the hotel as it was near Gare Du Nord & there would be no further travelling involved once we arrived at the station except for a 7 min walk to the hotel. The exterior of the hotel is modern, as well is the reception area with its quirky lobby; there is a little restaurant/bar serving dinner in the evenings (although some nights you have to carry the food to your room rather than sitting in); a computer in lobby to use free of charge as well as wifi access in each room (unfortunately my mobile wifi never did work once during stay). There is a private car park (payable) within hotel & two hotel lifts. The continental breakfast was great and the breakfast room big & spacious. It was trial & error each morning as to whether we managed to find a free table; some days empty & some days full to the brim. Loved their fresh croissants & pancakes ‚Äì absolutely delicious. What disappointed me was the room. The corridor narrowed quite badly towards our room (715) which meant that the room next door to ours & also the facing two where all in very close proximity of each other & every door squeaked very badly. Although Room 715 was non-smoking it did have an unpleasant smell (maybe stale smoke?!). It was noticeable each time you entered the room but once in for an hour or so your nose adjusted. The hotel does have a sign in the room stating that if you have a problem, contact them, & they will endeavour to have it sorted within 15 mins. It was being specific to problems with the bed, etc, but I didn't feel it worth my while complaining as my problems were of a smelly room; air-con that despite being at the highest level gave out no cool air whatsoever (only loud humming); a room that was so close to the surrounding rooms that you heard squeak-bang at all hours of the day/night when the guests left/returned to their rooms (when they chatted outside their room you felt like they were standing in yours ‚Äì it was that loud); no kettle; very narrow shower that had my derri√®re sticking to the shower curtain (which didn't help when I had to jump quickly away from the water that mysteriously changed from hot to scalding without warning) ‚Äì no way could the hotel fix any of those problems in 15 mins! The corridor on 7th floor was an awful drab colour ‚Äì cream & brownish colour with painted brown doors; drop down to the 3rd floor, or below, & they have more updated d√©cor with nice fresh wooden doors and poppy print carpet. I didn't hate my stay but I didn't overly enjoy it either ‚Äì the smell did bother me. Maybe if you are a smoker or have no real sense of smell then it would not bother you as much. It is, however, an ideal location for accessing the Gare Du Nord. NB If walking from Gare du Nord station; once out of station turn left and walk straight until you come to a crossroads with Rue la Fayette (runs from your right to left). Cross road ahead & then take street on left and begin walking down Rue la Fayette; crossing over the railway bridge; Ibis hotel is on left-hand side just over the bridge. Louis Blanc, Chateau Landon, Gare de l'Est & Gare du Nord metro stations are all within walking distance. Chateau Landon may just beat Louis Blanc to being the closest (approx 3 min walk). There are some lovely restaurants across from the exit of Chateau Landon ‚Äì no more so than Le Chateau Landon Restaurant ‚Äì serves lovely food & strong cocktails. There is also a bakery and mini-market across road which is really handy for hotel.",2012-10-15,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,2 stars,"I am a fan of IBIS and would say I am a loyal customer. But what is advertised on the website and how the hotel looks are two different pair of shoes. To be fair we arrived early and we were checked in without hesitation, which really pleased me. But the bad awakening came when we entered the room. The room was on the 5th floor and extremely tired and dirty. The bathroom floor was still full of hair from the previous occupants. The black out curtain was half hanging, but was not fixed, neither on the second day. On the first day we called down to receive some extra towels and an extra pillow. The receptionist informed us that they have no extra pillows (o.k. point taken it is a budget hotel after all), but that the towels will be send up to our room. To this point in time I am still waiting for my extra towels. The breakfast is also a let down. The employees who replenish the breakfast station and take the voucher are not very friendly. On the first day there was a big fly in the yoghurt bowl and instead of taking it away to the kitchen and make it appear that they change the whole bowl the employee only took a spoon and fished out the fly, right next to us. Regardless to say I did not have yoghurt that morning. And when walking past the kitchen the employees were sitting on the counters inside, when the kitchen door was left open. Not so right either. As I said so far that has been the worst IBIS hotel I have been to. On the upside it is in easy reach of Gare du Nord and Gare d' Est and another Metro Station. But I would not go there again. Not a happy camper this time around. Sorry IBIS",2012-08-16,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,1 stars,"I have stayed in places in Africa and Nepal without running water that were better that this hotel! I don't even know where to start! 1) The card key to access the room NEVER worked and you had to walk down to reception (or wait three hours for the elevator) to reactivate it every day after waiting at the reception desk for 20mins while they stood there and had a good ol' chat. 2) The shower alternated from scoulding hot to freezing cold every 30 seconds and the trick was to jump under during the transition stage that lasted 5 seconds. 3) The air vent hummed all night. 4) I paid for breakfast included every day of my stay, one day I wasn't on their list and wasn't allowed in to eat the breakfast I had paid for AND unlike all other hotels in the world where you simply give your room number, you had to go to reception (endure another 20 minute wait while they chatted to each other) to collect a ticket to go and have breakfast (kind of a crappy breakfast too). 5) Want to make a phone call? Forget it! You have to go back down to reception (remember you can't wait for the elevator) pay a 20 frickin euro deposit and sign three sheets of paper written in French (after the usual 20 min wait while they chat and ignore you) and climb the stairs back to your room (all other hotels you just use the phone when you want and they charge you at check out). I tried to dial out a number of times and it didnt work. After 5 calls to reception explaining that I wasn't getting an outside line they sent someone up rudely rolling her eyes to show me, only to find that it wasn't me being stupid, their instructions to get an outside line didn't work at all and it took an hour to fix the phone! Then getting my 20 euro refund was a nightmare - the call cost 40 cents - I offered to pay it to get my clean crisp 20 euro note deposit back - they refused and gave me 19 euro and 60 cents in small change! A bucket of change when I have weight restrictions at airports to worry about! Oh and sign another three sheets of paper in French. 6) A restaurant that was open 1 of the 5 days I stayed there (those other days you had to take the food up to your room - remember the elevator is out of the question so climb flights of stairs carrying a tray of brown mush). And when you go in, you spend 15 mins making I don't know how many throat-clearing noises and banging on the counter to get someone's attention until a fat guy waddles out with a look as if to say, ""why are you interrupting my sitting around time?"" 7) The hotel is a million miles from anything. I had to walk briskly 30 mins to get to the nearest tour bus stop. So at least an hour of walking a day and I don't dawdle - so an average person maybe 40 mins one way. 8) Cleanliness was crap - moving things around gives the illusion that they've cleaned but doesn't mean they've actually cleaned 9) You had to put all your weight into to door and lean with your shoulder against it to get it open and closed (after reactivating the card at reception don't forget) 10) TV doesn't let you turn the volume up above whisper volume so with the loud street noise below, you have no chance of hearing the tv, so learn to lip read. I am getting angry reminiscing, so I might stop now. Worst hotel I have ever stayed at in my life and I have travelled the world and seen some bad places!",2012-08-15,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,3 stars,"The first thing people must remember (which I learned the hard way) is that there are two Ibis Gare Du Nord hotel. Both are in Rue La Fayette but on opposite ends of the road. One is about 250m away from Gare Du Nords station and the other (this hotel) is about 5mins walk from Chateau Landon metro. I ended up in the first one and after waiting 10 minutes for their ""missing"" receptionist, the guy coldly told us we went the wrong way. Not a good start if you ask me. When we finally located the correct hotel, we checked in. I was definitely happier as this Ibis was in a better location than the other Gare du Nord Ibis. It was in a quieter area and the staff were a little bit friendlier. Our room was a corner room, it was spacious enough and has airconditioning (which is a plus) and tv. The room was clean and the bed was made up. The downside? No coffee facilities or refrigerator and the shower was a tad too small. The bathroom drain is also slow thus water builds up in the floor. After tinkering with the drain cap, we managed to get it flowing better. Apart from that the room was ok, but I wished they had at least a hot water boiler for coffee and a fridge. During our stay there was a sudden fire alarm and after giving reception a call we were told it was a false alarm. Make sure you put the do not disturb sign on the door as housekeeping has a tendency to just go in without knocking. Our biggest problem with the hotel was our room key kept on being deactivated. We had to have it reactivated every time we returned to the hotel. This was quite annoying especially when you are tired from a long day of walking. Nonetheless, the hotel is nicely located with a couple of nice cafes around to choose from. There are also 2 mini markets where you can buy chips and drinks nearby. The best part is the metro nearby is on the same line as most of the tourist attractions (i.e. louve, galeries lafayette, etc). So it was really convenient. Free wifi was sufficient and was relatively easy to connect to.",2012-07-09,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,2 stars,The hotel is not located in a good area also the breafast which i thought never fails with Accor hotels in India failed miserably with Ibis in paris... The crowd is just too much the hotel can handle and the room rates are not worth the cost... The door key fails every time you come back to the room and the A/C does not work ... the only choice you have is too change multiple rooms and finally get similar room and settle with it...,2012-07-09,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,3 stars,Stayed here for a night in May 2012. Check-in service is fast and efficient. Room is nice and clean. Price of the room is not included breakfast but free wifi everywhere (but didn't seem to work properly). Location is close to Chateau Landon Metro Stop. Not really that close to Gare Du Nord or Gare de L'Est. Ideal for just transiting for a day. Otherwise there are other hotels in a nicer area in Paris.,2012-06-23,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,4 stars,We arrived late but had the rooms available as paid for. Rooms were clean and had all amenities required. A bit spartan but as expected. The location was about 600 metres from Gare Du Nord. This is near the limit if you have 2 large suitcases. Magnetic room keys needed remagnetizing each day and that was a pain. Maybe they were just a bad batch. Overall we were impressed.,2012-06-04,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,3 stars,"I stayed here two nights while traveling for business. I chose this location because it's very close to Paris Gare du Nord where I was arriving. It is also very convenient to get to the RER to Charles de Gaulle airport. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Check-in is at 12pm, which is convenient, although when I asked if they could keep my bags until check-in, they directed me to the basement lockers that cost 3 Euro. This wasn't a problem for me because I had coins, but it could be an issue for someone who has just arrived and doesn't have currency. The room was clean but a little run down. The carpet was really shabby, but everything else was in good condition. Hotel rooms in Paris are expensive and usually quite sparse, so this is what I was expecting. The location is okay. If you need access to the north of Paris or the train station, this is a good place to stay. If you are in Paris for sightseeing, I would recommend finding a better location. Overall, this hotel is a good value for the price and I would stay here again.",2012-05-17,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,3 stars,"I stayed at the Ibis Chateau Landon for 3 nights in may 2012. The location of this hotel is very good. It is roughly equidistant between Gare du Nord and Gare de l'Est. It's easy to find and there are any number of cafes and restaurants in the area. Check in was quick and efficient and I was in my room within a few minutes. Service was generally of a reasonable standard, but this is certainly not a 5 star hotel. The room was small and older style, and had something of a nasty smell to it ( a few hours with the window open fixed that). Importantly, though, it was absolutely silent and sleep quality was very good. Wifi was free and worked well, though there was an annoying need to keep logging in each time I needed to use it. Hard to argue with a free service, though. Unbelievably, you cannot leave luggage at reception after checking out, and there is a need to trek down to the sub-basement to use overpriced coin lockers instead. Really, is it that hard to offer this service to guests? Overall, this hotel does what it says on the box - cheap and cheerful and offers a well-located crash-pad in Paris.",2012-05-13,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,2 stars,"It's a very basic hotel - clean, very near Gard du Nore BUT there are huge drawbacks. The hotel is HOT - the lobby, the rooms, the lifts. Sweltering in fact...and we visited at the start of May. I can only imagine what it's like in the height of summer. The rooms do have air conditioning but ours didn't work, which meant having to open the window. Being in the middle of Paris, this was noisy - but slightly better than being in a stuffy room. We paid ¬£89 for one night - very cheap for Paris. Pay another 20 quid and I'm sure you could get something better. The left luggage lockers are great however - on the -1 floor - 2.50, 3 and 5 euros depending on the size of your case.",2012-05-13,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,3 stars,"Location of this hotel is quite close to both Eurostar station and TGV station (about 5 min walk). I only stayed here one night and it was sufficient for my purposes. Cleaniness was average, no instructions on the air-conditioning made me turn on the heater instead of air-con forcing me to open the windows which was quite noisy. Only gripe was the luggage storage before check-in which cost 5 Euro and was underground in the basement locker area. No help from staff to use this & I had a big luggage. Worst of all, when i put in my 5Euros, a top locker open and there was no way I was going to be able to lift my 23kg luggage up onto it being a petite female. Tried but door slammed shut, 5 euro wasted. Complained at the service desk, who to their credit were quite sympathetic and helpful and let me store my luggage behind the counter but makes me think whether I could have done that in the first place ( as I saw other luggage also being stored there & even more when I returned later to get my luggage). Probably would stay here again given the good value for its location especially if catching the train.",2012-05-08,ibis chateau-landon

The only complaints were on the first day, in the middle of the afternoon, the fire alarm went off for 5+ minutes, but when we approached the front desk, they said it was nothing to worry about. Unfortunately our power went out for about 15-20 minutes, delaying our plans when we didn't have very much time at all in Paris. The cleaning staff also came in and tidied when we put up a ""do not disturb"" sign. Other than that, the breakfast buffet was amazing - crepes, breads, cheeses, yogurts, coffeehouse-style coffees, juices, cereals, fruit - and at 9 euro, definitely our best deal in Paris.

tripadvisor,3 stars,"IBIS PARIS CHATEAU LADRON There are several Ibis hotels near the railroad stations Gare de Nord and Gare de Est. This is one of them about midway between and north of both of them in a quiet ethnic neighborhood. Ibis hotels are part of the Accor Hotel Chain. They are utilitarian hotels popular with business people and frugal vacationers. They are typically located in convenient transport hubs in big European cities. They are clean comfortable but without frills. Almost all Ibis hotels have the same d√©cor, fabrics and colors. There are no true closets are drawers but shelves and alcoves. The beds are large and comfortable and the bathrooms spotless but usually only with a shower. In towns where you are going to be out all day this is a perfect place to crash for the night. Breakfasts are available but usually extra. Location is the only reason of choosing one Ibis hotel in Paris over a number of others. Convenience to the train stations is the reason for choosing this one. The immediate neighborhood is not that attractive with neighborhood stores and restaurants. Gare de Nord is the main station serving Charles de Gaulle Airport (Roissy) and the terminus of the Eurostar Chunnel trains to the United Kingdom. This station is a short walk from the hotel along a fairly smooth path. Convnenient for people using the stations particularly early in the mornings or late at night.",2012-04-29,ibis chateau-landon

The bonus was the secure luggage lockers, ‚Ç¨3 for the day, a godsend as our flight was 9.45pm!

The area is a bit rough, but not too bad, but you shouldn't go out on your own. The hotel is a tem niute walk from the Gare du Nord and its bars and restaurants - there is no reason to go elsewhere!

The staff here were great, willing to help me with a problem I had on the lock on my suitcase. Arriving back in Paris by train, it was great to only have a short walk from Gare Du Nord with 2 heavy suitcases. The rooms were not huge, but that's Europe. They were bigger than a lot of similarly-priced less modern hotels in Paris. It was clean & adequate for what I needed for 3 nights in Paris before returning home. Walking distance to anywhere & close to the Metro which is so easy to use. Lots of very friendly pubs & well priced restaurants & cafes in the area, & if you can find it nearby, there is the best Vietnamese cafe I have ever eaten at. People were friendly, travelling on my own at that point was great to have people in the street so eager to give directions or sit & talk to me to help me with my French & provide company. Possibly one of the freindliest areas in Paris I have ever stayed at. Good value for money. Not flash, but definitely all you need both at the hotel & in the area. I'd stay there again. If travelling by train to & from other parts of Europe, the proximity to Gare Du Nord is fantastic. Not too close. Too close to the station is very touristy, this was a short walk & the bars & cafes etc are frequented by locals, so you pay local, not tourist prices for drinks & food.",2012-02-13,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,2 stars,"Describing a Ibis hotel is futile 'cos everyone knows what to expect - it is like getting in to McDonalds. This follows along same lines. Maybe a little older. Still clean. Rooms are of decent size compared to Parisian standards. Front desk staff are friendly - again by Parisian standards. They offer ""free wifi"" along with some rates. I got it. Realized it is only valid for 200MB of data transfer per 24 hours. If you are checking e-mails, this is adequate. If you plan to go online and watch stuff on youtube, etc this will last for about 5 minutes. You have to pay for a Euro 9.95 connection with unlimited download. This hotel is walking distance from Gare du Nord. So, if you have to get to the airport or the Parc de Exposicion ( main exhibition hall where they conduct shows like Maison Objet, etc), it is convenient. But it is not one of the delightful neighborhoods of Paris. And the streets around this hotel gets a little lonely at night. I had no problem but I wouldn't recommend this for a solo female traveler. Not even good eating places around. All in all, I would stay here again only if I an traveling alone and they are offering a fabulous price ( Euro 70 to 100 depending upon the season).

We did get a good night sleep and were looking forward to the breakfast as the ibis menu is better than those at an Etap hotel. We could in retrospect have waited a hour and got a reasonable service, but we went in at 9am. There were quite a few seats to spare, but no cups, plates, dishes or glasses. We decided to press on to make the best of our last day. We took each a tray and serviettes and got started. After ten minutes we managed to grabs some glasses and so got some juice. Then later came some cups, but never enough for everyone, so we got a hot drink. Finally there were some clead plates and dishes, this was at leat half an hour after the start. The dishes were still hot and so water on the dispensery had to be used to cool them down and then discarded.

The neighbourhood is not the most greatest, but I never felt threatened and it is next door to ""Little India"" where there are many good curry houses. The rooms are small, but adequate. Mine was on the top floor at the end of the corridor. The bathroom had black marks on the ceiling, but I could not tell if this was damp, or just in need of a coat of paint. Some of the tiles around the bath taps needed attention too. I had an early morning breakfast and it seemed to me that some of the food had just been brought out of a freezer without time to defrost, so tasted cold and wet. usually the standard at Ibis hotels is better then this, which is one of the reasons I use them regularly when in France. Unless you need good access to one of the stations, I would seriously consider using one of the other hotels in the Ibis chain while in Paris. The hotel is adequate and if booked early is good value, but it could do with refurbishment.",2011-09-22,ibis chateau-landon

But the Ibis Gare du Nord was a dump, in a less than desirable area - and for all these negatives, the room rate was only 16 Euros less than my stay the week earlier at a very charming hotel, in a great area, Grand Hotel ds Balcones.

We arrived early in the morning and the reception was kind enough to allot us our room. The room was small but it was fine with us since we didnt plan spending most of our time in the hotel. The bed was comfortable but the interiors of the room needed some makeover. The breakfast at the hotel was good.They served cereals,bread,crossaints, curd,fruits and coffee which was very fullfilling. The hotel is located at a very convenient position. You could either use the Chateau Landon metro which was closeby or you could go to Gare du Nord which was about ten mintues walk. There are many Indian restaurants around the place which offer decent food. If you have a late night flight and want to check out in the afternoon you can store your luggage in the lockers at the hotel for a small sum.

tripadvisor,5 stars,"We needed to stay near Gare du Nord overnight to avoid a transport strike and I did quite a bit of shopping around online for a good hotel option. Most budget hotels in this part of Paris seem to be small, unhelpful, unclean, or in bad areas if you believe the reviews. This Ibis was great value - under 100 EUR for a large double room for the night - and well exceeded our expectations based on previous Parisian hotels. The room was very modern, clean and had lots of space. It was quiet, with good double glazing and a very spacious bathroom/wet-room which looked disabled-accessible. The reception desk were helpful and friendly, whether it was a code for the free hotel wifi, or change for the luggage lockers in the basement (very handy to leave your stuff so you can nip back just before your Eurostar and make the 5 minute trip to Gare du Nord). The area was fine - nicer than the streets immediately around Gare du Nord, and walking distance (maybe 20-30 mins) to the Seine. The only downside (which wasn't really too bad in October) was very warm room temperature, and pretty unresponsive air conditioning. All in all, a great little hotel.",2010-10-14,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,1 stars,"We've stayed at a number of IBIS' before, so we know to expect basic accommodation - that's what you pay for, but our room was a disgrace. The bathroom had obviously been flooded, so the carpet in the hallway was badly stained, the toilet was starting to pull away from the wall and the bathroom door was so warped and water damaged that it wouldn't go close to closing. We made a complaint about the room, but the hotel was fully booked, so the 'solution' was to call in a tradesman to look at it the next day. The next day we had to ask what the solution was - the answer took around an hour to find out. Nothing could be done for our stay, but we were offered a slight discount. The room should never have been let out in the first place. The receptionist wasn't very helpful and seemed to want us to go away. It was a rubbish way to end an otherwise great trip in France.",2010-10-13,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,3 stars,"Firstly, the best thing about this Hotel is it's location for access to public transport. Being close to both Gare du Nord and Gare de l'Est means you have access to 7 separate metro lines. In addition to that, a short walk down rue la Fayette connects you to another line. I happened to be in Paris for an exhibition at Porte de la Villette, close to CDG Airport. Coincidently, the Paris Motor Show was taking place at Porte de Versailles at the other end of Paris. The location of the hotel enabled me to make both exhibitions on the same day easily and also allowed me to make full use of my 5 day Paris Visite travel card. The hotel is exactly what you would expect for a listed 2 star establishment. Very much like a Japanese Hotel in that offerings are basic but everything works. The hotel was fully booked during my stay but the front desk staff were helpful with advice. One perk that surprised me was the free wifi offered not just at the reception but also in the room which is a boon for iPad users. Rooms are basic and the bathrooms are small, although no more so then other hotels I have stayed in Paris. From the evacuation chart at the back of the door, it looks like rooms ending in x01, x15 and x16 are slightly roomier although don't think the front office staff are able to allocate the rooms in advance. There are a few cafe's around the hotel but they don't open as early as the hotel cafe. I would recommend taking the breakfast option at the hotel to allow you to have a longer day out roaming Paris. Having said that, the neighbourhood around the Hotel whilst safe, is not particularly interesting. Be aware of the 3 sex shops you will pass on the way to the Hotel from the railway station. Not a good introduction to the neighbourhood but there are some other interesting shops furthen up the road. For this McD fans, there is one about 10 mins walk from the hotel opposite the road from the Jaures metro station. I would go back to this Hotel as it is functional and is great for public transport. Just remember that they only claim to be 2 star and for what I paid, I can't really complain about anything!!",2010-10-03,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,2 stars,"I'm very famailiar with Ibis Hotels, so I wasn't expecting too much - but this hotel had a couple of annoying problems. THE AIRCO basically doesn't work. The reception staff did provide us with an additional fan cooler - but still, on a hot late summer night it wasn't sufficient. Unlike other Ibis's where you've got individual and effective aircos in each room, this hotel has some kind of collective system - which made a considerable noise, but that's all. I couldn't feel any air (cool or otherwise) coming through the vents in either of the two rooms I was in. BANGING DOORS - I don't know whether it was the bathroom doors of the adjacent rooms or the main room doors, but every night I was woken up with noises like gun shots, at 1.00am, 5.00am, 6.00am etc. All resulting in me feeling very ragged at breakfast, CLAUSTROPHOBIA: All Ibis rooms are small, but the first room the reception gave me was very claustrophobic. I immediately went to reception and they managed to change me to a 'renovated' room which was indeed somewhat better. No bigger, but definitely better. Maybe requesting a renovated room is a good idea for anyone planning to stay here. AND NOW THE PLUS POINTS HELPFUL STAFF - unlike other reviewers I found the staff willing and eager to help. I got my room changed, was given a ventilator, and extra sheets. THE BISTRO The little bistro restaurant on the ground floor might not look like much, but its unpretentious Northern French theme actually worked, and the food, freshly prepared was of a high standard and the staff were friendly. THE LOCATION While Chateau Landon is a little bit off the beaten track, it is only a few minutes walk from both the Gare de l'Est and Gare du Nord. In many ways it's quite ideally situated, you just have to work out which metro station is best for you to use, depending on where you're going. RECOMMEND? I will probably try to get a room somewhere else on my next trip to Paris - although I would stay here again if I had too, especially in winter. I hope the hotel management take note of my feedback.",2010-09-04,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,4 stars,"I had a two-day gap in a business trip to London, and decided to take the Eurostar to Paris to see a special exhibition on Meroe at the Louvre, eat at a couple of my favorite restaurants, and hang out among the bouqanistes along the Seine. I didn't plan to be in my hotel room much at all - I just wanted a clean, basic, reasonably priced place to sleep for one night (two days), with luggage storage available, near the Gare du Nord. This Ibis fit my requirements. It's about a 10 - 15 minute walk from the Gare du Nord, where the Eurostar comes in - and even closer to the Gare de L'Est. It helps if you print out a detailed map of the area to have with you, or have an e-map like the Rough Guides one on your cell phone or PDA. It can be confusing to figure out exactly where you are when you first exit the Gare du Nord, since there are multiple exits, but once you figure that out with the help of your map, it's an easy walk to the hotel. The hotel is also quite close to the Chateau Landon stop on Line 7, which takes you down to the tourist areas along the Seine. The area around the hotel is mildly seedy, but I didn't feel unsafe walking around during the day or early-to-mid evening. I didn't come back late, so can't speak to the late night conditions. In any case, it's no worse than many areas of New York that I've stayed in, and felt less safe in... The rooms were basic, but met my needs. A toilet and shower with adequate hot water, a place to hang some clothes, some shelves to put other stuff on, and free wi-fi, which was a nice bonus. It was not hot while I was there, so I didn't need to open my windows. With closed windows, I didn't notice any noise out of line with what you normally get in any big city. One key point for me was a place to store my overnight bag during the day. I have had a bad time in the past trying to leave luggage in the Gare du Nord, so wanted to be able to leave my bag at my hotel, and then swing back by the hotel to pick it up on my way to catch the last evening train back to London. This Ibis has pay lockers in a little room off the first floor of their underground parking. I was a little nervous about trusting pay lockers, which in my experience are often broken, but these turned out to be nice and appeared well-maintained. I paid about 3 or 4 Euro for a medium size one, which easily held my roll-aboard and backpack for the day, leaving me free to run around Paris with just a small fanny pack. I speak good French, so I can't comment on the English capabilities of the staff. Overall, this is a great basic place to stay near the Gare du Nord, ideal if you just want a place to sleep. It is not, however, a place to stay if you are trying to enjoy lots of amenities offered by your hotel itself.",2010-06-04,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,3 stars,"We stayed there for 5 nights in July 2009. The location is very good, there are few metro stations nearby: Chateau London, Luis Blanc, Gare D'Est, Gare du Nord, Stalingrad. If you arrive to Gare du Nord, you have to walk for 15-20 minutes to the hotel. The rooms are clean, with TV, hairdryer, free Wi-fi connection (just need to get the password at the reception everyday). It was a bit annoying as it was rather noisy in the street, even at night. There was no air-conditioner, or it was broken. So, you should make sure, that your windows go to a silent street, not the busy one. The breakfast is good, not something special, but enough to eat and take something to eat with you during the day. Everything is fresh. There is no cabin in the bathroom, you should take a shower on the floor. It is a good, clean, well-located hotel at reasonable price. The supermarket is at 10 minute distance.

tripadvisor,1 stars,"I have to agree with a previous review about the location of this hotel - you would be better to get off at Gare de L'Est or Chateau Landon (Metro) which are much closer indeed than Gare du Nord. Well, where to I start... 1) Breakfast is as booring as (use your imagination!) - it was the same thing every singe day. Some potatoe cake, tasteless cheeses, fatty hams and stale bread, no flavour yoghurts and cheapie cereals. The fruit was probably bought from the Pakistani corner shops which stink of urine and for 8 euro's you can walk about 1km down the road to a much better cafe for a bigger breakfast. 2) Airconditioning was busted and the pathetic fans they had in each room did nothing but circulate the body odor. Opening the window was a good idea for fresh air but the sirens and scooters from the main road outside meant a crappy nights sleep. When we complained it was said to us by the little Indian behind the counter ""There is a sign telling you the AC is broken"" - so much for the 15 mins satisfaction guarentee! 3) Some of the staff seriously need a personality check - if they don't want to be there then they should be sacked and hire people who actually want to give a damn about you and not grunt at you. Even when you greet them in French - how arrogant it was to be greeted with a snare - at least I tried to speak the language! There is an All seasons down the road which looks much nicer and there was another Ibis much closer to the Montmarte which was also the same price and looked a lot better than this hotel.

The bathroom is not much more than a cupboard. Shower was good though. And whatever you do don't stay here in warm weather - the air conditioning does not work and it is way too noisy to open a window Breakfast buffet is good value at EUR 8 although coffee was awful. I paid EUR 105 to stay here. I guess for Paris that's cheap but it is still an awful lot of money for very little.",2009-06-06,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,3 stars,"Stayed for 2 nights at this hotel. Very small and simple rooms and you can pick up any conversation at the same floor. But it's cheap, clean and the staff is very helpfull.

They have there own garage. very usefull in paris",2009-05-03,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,3 stars,This is a normal IBIS offering a basic but satisfactory service. The rooms were clean and functional but lack any flare. Staff at the hotel were polite and well informed. Best feature is the very close proximity to Gare du Nord.,2008-03-12,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,1 stars,"Good location, just a 5min walk from Gare de l¬¥Est or Nord, the next metro stop is equally near. We only came to sleep a couple of hours during our weekend trip, and thank god we didn¬¥t stay longer. Why? Well, first of all staff - the front desk was barely motivated to welcome guests, check-in was done quick but not in a very friendly atmosphere. Staff in the breakfast room was much more outgoing and even offered a smile. Breakfast was ok, but for 8 EUR p.P. I¬¥ve had better choice. During the time we stayed there they had constructions works in the 2nd floor - the hotel was far from full that weekend but yet they placed us on the 3rd floor where we could ""enjoy "" some late construction work. Despite booking a double, we got two single beds in a room which stank of cold smoke - awful. When checking out, we asked if we could leave our bags in the baggage room for some time - no, they only have lockers you have to pay for.",2008-02-18,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,3 stars,"The hotel is behind Gare du Nord station about a 5-10 minute walk over a railway bridge. Compared to other hotels in the area it doesn't represent any particular good value of money or reason to stay there. From experience there are much better hotels of the same price in the area, especially to the front of the station rather than behind it. The area is really grotty and feels unsafe and very eastern european. Every direction will take you into dark streets and nasty little shops. The hotel feels like a youth hostel. The stark white walls, the cheap faded pictures, the pillar-box red paint on any available wood surface, the coin lockers in the dank basement. The bedrooms are just white walls and two beds and a TV. The bathroom was OK and ours had a bath. I will say, the beds are comfortable and you have extra blankets and pillows in the wardrobe, if necessary. Breakfast was not included but there are some great pattiseries around the station which are probably better than what might be served at the Ibis. If you are passing through and need a comfortable, warm bed for the night, this will do. But it's not on my list to stay there again.",2008-01-29,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,4 stars,"Went to Paris for the weekend with my boyfriend, and I found what I expected: Ibis hotels have very basic rooms and are more or less just the same everywhere. But are excellent in terms of rates and in comparation with other buget hotels in Paris (terrible rooms, services and awful quality in breakfasts). This hotel in particular is in need of some restauration work, but still it's ok to pass the weekend. The staff is efficient and tht breakfast buffet is very good. I reccomend this hotel because of the excelent price, location and because you will find basic but eficient services!",2008-01-15,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,3 stars,"I booked online at ibishotel.com more than 30 days in advance so got the super cheap Happy 30 Rate which was less than ¬£35 per room per night. It's not the best Ibis I have stayed at but you might think otherwise. I had a non-smoking room. Others have said smoking rooms really smell but my non-smoking room had no bad smells. No good view though - just looked out into the street and neighbouring houses. Hairdryer has to be rented for ‚Ç¨20 but you get this back at the end of your stay. As a brit, I didn't like the breakfast (‚Ç¨7.50) - but here is what you get buffet styke and all you can eat: 4 cereals. milk, baguette style bread, this weird flat breat which you can toast, apples, oranges, pears, bananas (always spotty and very ripe), 3 types of youghurt in tubs, nutella, butter, honey, 3 types of jam, plain croissants, chocolate croisannts, crepes, this weird baked cake with almonds on it, 2 types of fruit cake, 3 types of mini-muffins, ham slices, big cheese wedges, 3 types of fruit juice, 12 or so types of tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Same every day. Free french newspapers with breakfast. Felt uncomfortable with the staff hanging around during breakfast, joking amongst themselves and using the buffet - at an independant hotel this would seem cool and freindly, but when they are wearing uniforms and sitting on the tables it just seemed like they were slacking off. There is a restaurant which opens at 6pm, not used much. A bit pricey - ‚Ç¨5 for an entree or dessert and ‚Ç¨10 main meal. If you did 2 courses then it's ‚Ç¨12.50. One internet terminal - 15 mins costs ‚Ç¨5 and the terminal is not as high speed as you want. No printer so if you check in online you can't print a boarding pass. 14 television stations of which 1 is english (BBC world). Other channels show american shows and movies but dubbed in French. During my stay, about 3/4 of the channels went down one day and had to wait till next day to get fixed. Really I should have then got the room for free as they didnt fix it within 15 mins but I paid online in advance and didnt want to push the issue. Bed is narrower and shorter than normal UK double so unless you are a skinny couple, you wont be able to move. Prob 20cm narrower than UK double. Im 160cm and if I were any taller my feet would be hanging over the end. But all rooms come with second extra thick blanket so thats a plus. Bathroom is very small but there are no probs as it is perfectly laid out to maximise space. Toilet had that weird water smell. Shower was a bit odd to work out as you have to turn on a tap then pull up a lever but once you figure it out its fine. Some days I had to run the hot water for over 5 mins (I'm not kidding) to get it actually hot, not luke warm. Shower head seemed a bit loose as water also dripped down side but it did the job. Adequate closet space for a short stay. 5 coat hangers, one hanger with clips on it. Most staff speak English. There is also a bar and lounge area but I didnt use them. Close to Magenta and Gare du Nord metro and RER station with some good restaurants on the walk from the hotel. Expect to pass a few homeless people, sex shops (they have signs saying its a sex shop but thats about it, they are not scary and no undesireables hanging around) and condomn vending machines, but these are all over Paris. So location is relatively good, and not as scary as people would have you believe.",2007-12-28,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,1 stars,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 non-consecutive nights. The hotel is ok, given the price we payed for 3 of these nights (49 euros). It's close (5 min walk) to a large station (where the Eurostar arrives - Gare du Nord) and very close to a small one (which is 4-5 stops away from the Louvre - Chateau Landon). Some people of the staff are polite, some aren't. But the worst of all was my wife's sunglasses being stolen when she left them inside the room on the table. She shouldn't have done that, but this is no excuse for someone stealing them (I think it was the hotel maid, she was extremely unpolite when we told her we did not want the room done at the time she knocked the door, and asked her for coming back later). We had asked for smoking rooms, but the room they gave us had a very, very strong smoke smell, that evend smokers found very unpleasant. I can recommend this hotel for the price and convenience, but beware of your stuff, don't leave anything valuable inside the room, as there is no safe.",2007-12-19,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,4 stars,"Stayed in the Ibis Chateau Landon for 14 nights in August 07. Yes, I could have stayed in a ""charming"" Paris apartment for about the same nightly price as the Ibis, but most apartments I saw in that price range were extremely small, on the 5th or 6th floor of a walk-up building and had no air conditioning and only a small range to cook on. Tack on a hefty security deposit for the apartment rental, and it actually made more sense to stay in the hotel and eat out. Not sure who these other reviewers talked to at the Front Desk, but in 14 days, I never once ran into a single reception clerk who could not speak perfect English - and I always started off in French and after about a minute they would smile at my lousy pronunciation and respond in English. The only staff I met that couldn't speak English were a few of the housekeepers and a maintenance man. Not a big deal - if you have a problem with your room, you will definitely find more than one person at the Front Desk that speaks English - and if it isn't up to your high standards, then maybe you'd better consider taking some French lessons before you go back to Paris - it is their country after all! The size of the room was actually pretty good - no, it's not the size of a standard room you might get at a hotel in the Midwest, but it was much larger than a hotel room in New York City. The room was lacking a dresser and had no real ""closet"" to stick your suitcase - just a small area where you can hang a few outfits so I used the desk to hold my luggage. The bathroom was a good size and the shower was big enough to move around in, although poor design means water gets on a tile ledge around the shower then drips onto the floor so housekeeping has to mop up a small puddle every day. I had a room on the 7th Floor with an excellent view of the Basilica of Sacre Couer - nice to see it in the morning sun and late at night when it's all lit up. Never had a problem with noise - but my room was located far away from the elevators. The neighborhood around the hotel is fine. Yes, there are some ""seedy"" businesses nearby (sex shops, adult bookstores), but I walked the area nightly by myself and never felt uneasy. I regularly saw police patrolling around the train and metro stations. In August, many businesses in Paris are closed for vacation, but I was still able to find a couple of decent restaurants, a good self-service laundromat, a delicatessen and a patisserie right near the Ibis. My only issues in 14 days...one morning I got stuck in the elevator for about 10 minutes because of a neighborhood power outage and the emergency lights didn't kick on inside the elevator cab so I could not see where the ""alarm"" button was. I banged on the door for about 4 minutes and a housekeeper heard and radioed a maintenance man right away. When the power went back on, the elevator went straight to the lobby and the manager was there and was extremely concerned. I actually laughed about it, but did tell her the emergency lighting needed to be fixed because next time they may have someone who is claustrophobic or freaked out by pitch blackness stuck in the elevator. The other issue was Ibis provides a card in all the rooms detailing their concern for the environment and asks guests who don't want towels changed every day to hang them on the door to save on water and energy. I neatly hung my towels and housekeeping still took them off the hook and laid out freshly laundered towels every day. Oh well...I tried to do my part to save the planet. All in all, a decent hotel for the price. If you expect the same level of service and amenities as the Georges V or the Athenee for 70-80 Euros a night, you're off your rocker.",2007-11-19,ibis chateau-landon

The room smelled of smoke and they had a silly rule where you could not sit in the bar/restaurant unless you were eating as well as drinking. This applied even when the restaurant was empty. The lounge where we were supposed to carry our drinks was often full. Finally, there was no hot water on one day from first thing to mid afternoon. No reduction in the bill was offered.

In terms of features, rooms are what you would expect from a hotel with a 2-star rating belonging to a major chain. My room was certainly not cleaned properly however; there was a piece of used dental floss on the desk from a previous occupant and the floor in the bathroom was sticky.

tripadvisor,3 stars,"10 minutes walk from Gare du Nord, which has a rail link to Charles de Gaulle Airport, so no messing about with the metro while still wrestling with your luggage. The sex shops you pass have nothing offensive of show so nothing to be bothered by there. The hotel has been refurbished and rooms are clean, staff are friendly enough without going over the top, answering any questions politely and efficiently. One problem was we'd booked twin rooms and were given doubles, this could definitely have been a problem for someone else but, as ex rugby players, we just got on with it. The beds were more than big enough for a couple of fat boys. There are a few good bars and eateries opposite Gare du Nord so you could finish off the night locally, which was really handy. Main bonus of staying here is the easy links to all the tourist attractions via the metro and I'd have no hesitation staying here again",2007-10-03,ibis chateau-landon

Room was adeqaute, standard Ibis set up. Twin room is 2 singles pushed together. We came by car so parking was essential.The underground parking is tight, but again safe and adequate.

tripadvisor,4 stars,"This 2 star, Ibis hotel was quite a pleasant suprise! Not expecting too much for ¬£250 for 5 nights in central(ish) Paris for two of us, this hotel offered everything we wanted! 5/6 mins walk from the main train terminal of Gare Du Nord. We bought a 5 day travel pass which was well worth the cost and was spent over and over again! If you read reviews on lower cost hotels in Paris you always find that they are described with basic small rooms. The room we stayed in wasn't huge, but was bigger than most similar star hotels we have had in London! It was very nicely decorated, extremely clean (which goes a very very long way with me!) and had all the necessary facilities. The staff were ok, pleasant enough, not always completely helpful, but no real problems. Spoke good enough English. We didn't book breakfasts, but paid 7 euro's each on the first morning. It was OK, a basic continental breakfast, but we didn't bother after that, it was cheaper and much the same at a local 'Pains' coffee shop at entrance to railway station. The hotel area does appear slightly 'rough' on first appearance, but we had no problems what-so-ever and never felt threatened at all. As with most cities, people are just minding their own business of the day and not interested in you. We did spend a LOT of money the week we were there, we got a 4 day museum pass, which again, made more than full use of. Eating out is expensive, but just about what you would expect in a City.

tripadvisor,3 stars,"I give this hotel no more than a 3 star because it is a mediocre Ibis. The reason is it is not a good location if you're coming and going to the Gare du Nord. You will find some shady characters, sex shop, and unparis people in unparis surrounding. Or should I say, not the type of touristy place you see in the travel guide. Everything is acceptable during daytime, but like flipping a burned pancake when the night appears. BUT, if you get off from the Chateau Landon METRO, it is very much okay, the walk to hotel is shorter, safe, and quiet. The thing is why do you want to spend more money from Gare du Nord to Chateau Landon? It is unnecessarily waste of money for a mere perceived fear (at night), yet don't you just hate it when you can't just relax during your vacation and have to sour your face and show that you're not easy to ruffle with. After all this is the dreamed Paris vacation that we want to relax and enjoy, not tense. I stayed at Sofitel La Defense before moving to this hotel. And I see there is an Ibis there not to far from the Esplanade La Defense Metro exit. The area is quiet, nice, and safe even at night. And it lies in the line of Metro 1 which cover most of the touristy places. If you take the Metro 1 often, you don't even have to change to another Metro to get to the hotel. So I regret for not staying there, and will definitely stay at the Ibis La Defense next time. Another thing that bug me is that I couldn't pay with the only cash I have left, Euro 500. They kept saying there wasn't enough change for them since they have a policy not to keep a large amount of cash. Logicall or not, a hotel that size doesn't have change for Euro 500 is such a joke. All in all, the hotel is standard Ibis, nice and clean room, but the location is a turn off at night when you're coming from the train station.",2007-05-21,ibis chateau-landon
tripadvisor,4 stars,"Booked this hotel via the Ibis website for a stay of three nights in April, we were lucky enough to get a deal for the three nights and it worked out extremely cheap for our stay, especially compared to some other hotels which didn't offer en suite and Air Con and were not as convinient to stay in. This hotel is easy to find once you leave the Gare De Nord station, make sure you use the Rue de Dunkerque exit, it's just a five to ten minute walk with baggage to the hotel, so not too excessive. Check in was easy enough, although the lady in reception didn't speak English, my French was a little rusty but was sufficient, the reception was clean and well laid out, with a small restaurant and bar in the corner, which we used every night to have a few beers before going to bed, as it was a nice atmosphere to sit in and reflect on the day or to make plans for tomorrow. Two lifts serviced the floors. The room was small but adequate, clean and tidy, had Air Con and a TV, no safe or tea making facilities, but bathroom was clean and pleny of hot water for a shower or bath. Breakfast was an optional extra which we didn't use as there are plenty of cafe's and cake shops in the area, so choice was never an issue. The transport links were excellent as well, Gare De Nord is a main station that services the airport and has a few Metro staions close by, all the sight seeing tour busses stop outside too, so it's an excellent base to do your sight seeing from. Most of the staff did speak a little English and were happy to help whenever possible. Can't think of any real downsides to this hotel, there are a few adult shops by the station but that is only a minor thing that didn't bother us at all, but maybe be an issue with a young family, although I must say the area was pleasant enough and we didn't feel theatened at any time, even at night, I'd definately stay at this hotel again, and am looking at booking for a few days in July. There is a storage facility downstairs by the underground car park for your luggage if you needed to keep your suitcases etc stored after you checkout, only a few Euros and you'll have peace of mind that the baggage is locked away safe and secure until you collect it. Would recommend this hotel to anyone who's thinking of visiting Paris. Enjoy !!",2007-04-30,ibis chateau-landon

The hotel is very close to both Gare du Nord and Gare du l""Est. We arrived with Thalys, so it was just 5-8 minutes walking with luggage. We could even check-in at around 11 in the morning.

It is a standard IBIS common across much of Europe - decent quality and good value for money - paid 86 euros per night per room excluding breakfast - but rooms are much smaller than average. Staff are very helpful and speak good English. If you can speak a little French and/or have sufficient confidence to use the great bus and metro network, this hotel is ideally situated for most major attractions. The bus which leaves from outside the main door goes quickly to the centre of town. Otherwise, walk 5 mins to either the North or East train stations to catch one of the very many metro and RER connections.

tripadvisor,4 stars,"After about 2 weeks extensive search and booking and later cancelling many options, i zeroed on this one. The reasons: good reviews, central location, nearby to major station gare du nord and other metro and bus stops. And it definetly lived upto the expectations and its claim of making you satisfied in 15mins of your checkin. I would strongly suggest anyone who is visiting paris and looking for a great place to stay without spending much (un-necessarily) to just go ahead and book this. Positives: - centrally located, 5 mins by metro to opera - walking distance from gare du nord, major train station, trains available for airport, international trains. (cost saving on taxi). Just be careful to exit from the right gate of the station or else you may get confused about the hotel location. - nice, spacious (unlike few reviews who stated otherwise), clean and new rooms - bathroom with bathtub, shower and shampoo/soap supplies - flat screen tv (not sure if everyroom has it) - 7 euro breakfast which is value for money or exceeds that. - nice courteous, helpful staff - good airconditioning, it was pleasing cool inside the room considering it was hot summer when we checked in . Outside temp. was approx. 32 celcius. Negatives: really hard to find, but here are some: - less space for placing clothes, luggage etc. so could be a problem if u plan to stay for more than 3 days with big luggage to arrange in room - curtains not able to fully block the light, so u may find sunlight early in the morning which could wake you, annoying for people who love to sleep till late. ;) - ordinary city view from the window (but u go places to see, not the hotel) So my sincere advise to all those who wish to spend a weekend in paris, just stop thinking any more on your hotel and go for it and have a peaceful sleep, rest assured you won't be disappointed.",2006-08-08,ibis chateau-landon

There was not much in the way of niceties but the beds were very comfortable and the bedding changed daily. Extra pillows were available for the asking, together with soap, toiletries etc. We asked whether there was a secure box for our valuables and indeed there was, at the front desk, and the service was free! The little bathroom was a special blessing - always clean, lashings of hot water at all times, and controls that were simple and efficient, unlike some of the shower arrangements where a masters degree is required to work out how they operate! A pleasant breakfast room and an intimate little dining room completed then scenario (we did not dine there, being in Paris, but we saw that many did and the food looked very appetising).

At 69 Euro per night, within 5 mins walk of the Gare du Nord, the Ibis Paris Gare du Nord is an absolute bargain. That said, this is a typical European hotel and, having recently travelled in the USA, is not perfect. The rooms are very small, the walls are incredibly thin to the point that you can almost hear your neighbour breath. The hotel is aimed at the business traveller market however does not and will not provide items such as irons and ironing board for the traveller. Wifi is available, however unlike USA hotels this is quite an expensive service (approx. 10 Euro per day). Breakfast is included, standard European fare of bread rolls and meats.

Staff were extremely firendly and helpful and the little bar restaurant on the ground floor served up some excellent basic food. Drinks not that cheap but then it that wasnt so much of a surprise. We booked our hotel through a third party web site but would have been better going direct as the hotel advertises doubles from 75 euros a night. Breakfast, again basic, but I had everything I wanted so no complaints.

tripadvisor,4 stars,"We stayed four nights at the Ibis Gare de l'est in March 2003, and were quite pleased with our stay. The room was clean, adequate size and quiet. The buffet breakfast was excellent, and the hotel restaurant was very good. Service was fairly friendly. The location is within walking distance of the Gare du Nord (convenient if you are arriving by train from the Airport or by the Eurostar), and Metro Stations are nearby. The neighbourhood is not inspiring, but we had no problems. This is a very good budget hotel and very good value for the money. We would recommend the hotel if you are looking for a reasonable priced and good accommodation. Have rated the hotel as ""above average"" in terms of the value for the money spent and in consideration of its positive features. We would stay there again.",2004-01-06,ibis chateau-landon

tripadvisor,2 stars,"The Ibis hotel Canal Saint Martin is located Near the canal. There are lots of homeless people and people with metal health issues sitting right outside the front door of the hotel and sleeping rough on the canal towpath. There‚Äôs even people sleeping on old mattresses on the same street of the hotel. There is lots of rubbish strewn on the canal towpath, tents, mattress and graffiti. Thankfully there is a lock and bell on the hotel door to allow guests to get in and out of the hotel, which stops the homeless people getting in. It was ok but we never felt 100% safe walking back from the metro station - even in day light. A soup kitchen is situated about 50metres from the hotel on certain days and a lot of people gather there. The rooms in the hotel Canal Saint Martin are ok but are very small (ever so slightly bigger than the size of the double bed) and very basic. There is no kettle, no cups, no safe and no fridge in the rooms. The hair dryer isn‚Äôt great. WiFi is not great either as it kept dropping out. Towels are not changed daily. The hotel is NOT really well situated for the main tourist attractions of Paris. It‚Äôs at least a ten/fifteen minute walk over the canal to the metro and then it‚Äôs a good 45mins on a train to get to the main touristy parts of Paris .

I was a little worried that the rooms were going to be a little small, however the rooms were the perfect size and all we needed for 4 days of sightseeing and walking around Paris. The rooms were perfectly clean every morning and the bathroom was just lovely! However, the hot water and water pressure was not always the best if you were on the higher floors. The staff were very helpful, providing us with maps and guidance and recommendations for restaurants in the area. The breakfast was great, a medium sized selection that included some of Frances' wonderful items - croissants, baguettes, cheeses and others- we only were bored of breakfast on the last day. They also gave some paper bags to take fruit for the day which was a great added touch! The hotel was located about 5 mins to the nearest metro station, with another 6 min walk to an additional line. Very easy to get there with a supermarket as well nearby. I would recommend this hotel for a short stay in Paris with security which made us feel safe.",2019-06-28,ibis saint martin
tripadvisor,3 stars,We needed somewhere to stay the night before our Eurostar train home and we chose this hotel due to the price and proximity to the station. Reception area was very small but receptionist was friendly. We discovered our room was on the very top floor and as the lift only went up to floor 7 we then had to use the stairs with our cases up to floor 8. The room was big but in the attic and it was boiling and the air con was absolutely rubbish. The room had a double bed and two twin beds behind a partition. There was also lots of little flies in the room. Water pressure was appalling in the shower. We only walked up the road to the McDonalds so I can't really comment on the area but it didn't seem very pleasant.

The location is in a street where there are lots of homeless people, people on drugs and mentally unstable who loiter at the entrance of the hotel. This morning less that five metres from the front of the hotel there was a trail of fresh blood along the footpath which led to a pool of blood on the other side of the street. This afternoon, along the same street, there was two large pools of blood. It is an uncomfortable sight and we felt very unsafe, some taxi drivers won‚Äôt take us to the hotel. In addition to this, upon our arrival we were given a room which was not located in the hotel, rather, a bunker outside of the hotel on the fire escape stairs. It was the only room in the entire hotel like this. We asked to change rooms and they were unable to do so until the next day.

tripadvisor,2 stars,"This is probably the worst Ibis hotel in which I had the opportunity to stay. Even Ibis Budget hotels are better. Breakfast in this hotel is a failure. There is still something missing and you have to wait for the service to finally bring it. There are missing cups, cutlery, etc. There are probably only a few teaspoons in this hotel. To make yourself a coffee you have to wait until they finally wash a mug. . In addition, the booking system is misleading. It was written that up to 4 children can stay free in a room with their parents. Meanwhile, the lady at the reception decided that with 3 children we have too much one child and forced us to buy an extra room for 150 EUR for 2 nights. In the room, there is also a loud buzz every few minutes at night. I will definitely not stay there again.",2018-08-05,ibis saint martin
tripadvisor,3 stars,"Ibis Paris Canal St Martin is the smallest Ibis Hotel we've stayed in. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful but the hotel's small size means that facilities are quite limited. It has a 'small hostel' feel and the ground floor contains the reception, some sofa seating and the breakfast area which doubles as tables at which you can sit in the evening and have a tea or coffee from the vending machine. There is also a fridge from which cold drinks can be bought. Breakfast is adequate but the breakfast area is very cramped and one poor woman works tirelessly to try and keep supplies replenished. We were in Room 1, situated on the ground floor and opening directly from the lounge area. We found the room to be quite noisy as a result and the level of sound insulation generally was disappointing with quite a bit of noise from rooms above also. On the up side, the room was very large and well equipped with an enormous TV, plenty of space for a double bed and three singles and separate WC and shower room. The hotel is very well located for three metro stations putting most parts of Paris within easy reach, although the area around the hotel doesn't feel very safe in the evening and has very few places to eat or things to do. Overall, we would look for a hotel in a better area and with more facilities next time we're in Paris.",2018-07-21,ibis saint martin

Room rather small (although it was a triple), comfy bed, tiny bathroom, no amenities whatsoever. Cleanliness to be revised, as I found a used cotton bud under the sink at our arrival. Breakfast was just fine. However, there were positive features too, represented by the multi-lingual staff at reception, attentive and helpful in giving directions, and of course, the outstanding location, so close to Gare du Nord and other transports links, which make Ibis Canal Saint-Martin an ideal base to explore Paris.",2018-06-26,ibis saint martin

My room was on the second level facing the street but it was still remarkably quiet and there was no noise from the hallway or adjoining rooms. Service was good and breakfast was quite good with a variety of choices. I felt perfectly safe in the neighborhood. The bathroom design is quite odd and sort of amusing. I had to sit sideways on the toilet seat rather than the usual because of the way it was situated.

It‚Äôs well situated and we walked to the Sacre Ceur from the hotel which took about 45 minutes but we enjoyed it. Out of any ibis I have stayed in this is the most unique - the artwork and design of the hotel gave it a great feel and made it stand out. Pros: * Modern, different and quirky. * Close to four metro stations. * 20 minute walk from Gare Du Nord * 2 minute walk to Colonel Fabian Metro * 2 minute walk to supermarket / restaurants/ cafes. * on Canal Saint Martin (nice walks). * friendly staff. * clean hotel and rooms cleaned / towels changed daily. * breakfast available. * snacks / hot food available for order from room. * toiletries provided. * city map provided on arrival. * air con system and electric heater on the wall for the colder days (easy to use). * out top floor room looked out over Paris with a view of the Sacre Ceur. * decent sized television in the room. Cons: * the walk between Gare Du Nord and the Hotel wasn‚Äôt the best - we walked quickly to get through it. * the bed had a mattress topper on it that was smaller than the mattress which wasn‚Äôt the most comfortable. * breakfast is pricier than going up the road to a local cafe. * no tea/coffee facility available in the room.",2018-02-20,ibis saint martin

tripadvisor,3 stars,"There are plenty of Ibis in Paris and all are within close distance, a fact we are aware before our arrival. Got out the wrong exit at the metro station at the direction of two Metro staff and it sent us on a one-hour hunting mission on foot with three large luggages averaging 20kg each. The hunt was made worst by people or shopkeepers who pointed us in various different directions or a different Ibis despite us double confirming if they are pointing us to the Ibis Paris Canal St Martin. Only found the hotel when we gave up and bought local data as the Orange SIM we got in a neighbouring EU country didn't work despite that it claimed to be able to do so in the package when we bought it. This Ibis is on a quiet side street and more hideous compared to other nearby Ibis but perhaps this gives the hotel a quiet atmosphere and a boon for light sleepers. The area surrounding this hotel is a bit off but as many reviewers highlighted, a police station is just meters away. A walk to Gare-du-Nord takes about 15-20 minutes and walking back in the evening/night, we did brisk walks as we weren't entirely comfortable with the surrounding when it starts to get dark. The night receptionist is a man of few words. He appears cold and his responses were curt. Breakfast was pricey and we did not purchase them. Stayed in the attic which was the family room (Room 801). Lift only goes up to 7th floor and need to walk two flight of stairs up to the attic. So having huge and heavy luggage may be an issue. The room looks newly refurbished and is compact though we had the whole attic front to ourselves. May bump your head on the low end of the ceiling. There were a queen size bed on one side with the ensuite and at the other side of the partition, there were two single beds pushed closely together and a dressing table. Beds and pillows are a bit soft, which is not to my liking. Each side of the bed chamber has its own flat screen TV and a compact open space closet. Facing the entrance door, there is also another compact open space closet. Wifi connectivity was good. Compact bathroom size with an elevated or step-up shower section and powerful hot shower. Towels, toiletries and hair dryer were provided. On second day, only two out of four towels were replaced but matter was attended to the next day after highlighting to the front desk. A good budget hotel but will stay closer to Gare-du-Nord if taking Eurostar with heavy/bulky luggage. We requested for Uber which refused us when he knew we are headed to Gare-du-Nord citing there's an hour jam that way. We knew our bearings after three days and kid me not, so it's a report on that driver. Flagged a passing cab which was so hospitable to us and the journey took us to Gare-du-Nord in less than 5 minutes for 7euros on the meter, cheaper than the Uber Black that we requested.",2018-01-09,ibis saint martin
tripadvisor,4 stars,"We chose this hotel for its price, so we were not expecting much from it. However, we got quite a surprise and I can say we were certainly quite pleased by everything in the hotel. The personnel was friendly and helpful, and every staff we contacted spoke English. The room was clean, and appeared to have been recently renovated. However, it was quite small, though we did not mind with it, since we spend so little time in the room. Furthermore, we had a good quality of sleep since not many noises were heard. The hotel was quite close to three subway stations covering three lines, which got us in the main touristic attractions and other parts of the town in no time. The area, though seeming a bit shady at times, turned out to be safe at least for us, but you do have to be somewhat open minded to walk around there, especially at night. The breakfast, though a bit pricey, was amazingly good, especially if we consider we were in a 3-star hotel. They even offer small paper bags for you to bring out some food, including fruit! The only negative point is that the towel management system is quite lousy, and could be significantly improved. On some days we got one clean towel, on others we did not even get that. One day our floor towel was even removed without us having a replacement. Generally, the experience was quite positive, at a much lower price than the one charged by many hotels in Paris during Christmas, which is always a pricey time of the year.",2017-12-28,ibis saint martin

The breakfast was not included in the price but for the price they ask for it the offer is very good, especially because the hotel offers bags to pack food to take with you during the day. There is just one thing that is not really nice, which is the fact that the hotel doesn't change the towels very often. You have to ask them to do that, wish is something that is not very common. In general, I had a very good experience and I recommend very much, this place although the hotel is not located in the best of places it's a very quiet place and it's near 3 great underground stations.

tripadvisor,5 stars,"My partner and I stayed here for a week and were very pleased. The location was excellent, we arrived on the Eurostar into Gare du Nord and were able to walk there with our luggage. The hotel is positioned in the middle of three metro stations on two different lines which made getting in and out of the city really handy and it was only about a 400m walk to the closest one. The hotel staff were very friendly and didn't laugh as I butchered their language. The reception staff all spoke excellent English and were very helpful. The room was great, very clean and quite large for such a reasonable price. We had our own ensuite with good water pressure and temperatures. The room was quiet with air conditioning and an opening window. The wifi was included in the room and was fast and reliable. The only vaguely negative things I could say were that the king size bed was two single beds pushed together with a mattress over the top but the bases meant that there was a rise in the middle so one of us had to sleep on a slight slope. Having said that though, it was fine and we certainly didn't lose sleep over it. There was also a weird smell that we think was coming from the drain in the bathroom but we only noticed it for a minute when we came home for the evening and was gone as soon as we opened the bedroom window. Another massive plus was breakfast, I didn't include it automatically when I booked but I would highly recommend that you get it. The food was amazing, fresh and plentiful. The hours were good as well, from 6am for a full breakfast which included croissants, cheese, croissants, cold meats, pastries, did I mention croissants? A coffee machine with excellent hot chocolate, a large selection of teas including herbal teas, baguettes, yoghurts, cereals, fruit, crepes, an option to boil your own egg, toast, condiments and juices. A-MAZING!! The other thing I thought was excellent was the lunch bag option. As we finished breakfast, I made up a small baguette for each of us and took a piece of fruit for lunch.

The room is very spacious for Paris hotel. The TV is huge maybe 50-55"". The toilet and bathroom are separated. The bathroom is very big as well. They have double basin and the shower area is open and spacious. The king size bed is comfy and big. The 2 other beds is built using a sofa bed and 1 is extra bed. Free wifi for 2 devices only. Perfect for family with 3 children. Service is great. Check in and check out under 3 mins. The front office speaks perfect English. And best of all we got 30% discount for early booking with Accor. The only minus part of the trip is Paris hot temperature around 27-30 C without cloud during our stay, but it is better than raining.",2017-07-11,ibis saint martin
tripadvisor,4 stars,"I have only one complaint about my stay. The air conditioner didn't seem to work properly. We had it on the lowest (coldest) setting, and it still didn't really cool down the room. Thank goodness it was chilly and breezy at night and that we could open the windows. Other than that, I have nothing bad to say about our stay. It was a clean room, close to the metro, and in an up-and-coming neighborhood.",2017-07-01,ibis saint martin
tripadvisor,4 stars,This hotel is in good location near to Louis Blanc Metro only walk about 5 minutes. The room is small but new and clean. No electric kettle and no mineral water provided inside.

It's recommended for budget tourist who wants comfort hotel.,2017-06-28,ibis saint martin
tripadvisor,4 stars,"The location of this hotel was perfect for the price we paid. We stayed for 5 nights and paid ¬£135pp (or 150 euros pp) The location of the hotel was just a 5min walk to the metro stations (Louis Blanc and Javes) and 15min metro ride from the city centre (including stops) at just 1.90 euro one way pp. The hotel is also just a 5 minute walk from the local supermarket and right beside the canal, perfect for a nice walk on a sunny day. The hotel itself was easy to check in, friendly staff and happy to help! The rooms are small however it is an Ibis after all. The room was clean however very warm at night and with being on the street side made it very noisy if we opened the window. The bed was comfy and I think I would of had a good night sleep if it wasn't for the constant banging during the night, I am a heavy sleeper so I just about tolerated it but if you are a light sleeper it may not be the best. What I was most disappointed about was the lack of amenities in the room. No minibar or iron/ironing board in the room and no tea/coffee making facilities. I don't know if this is how Ibis operates, possibly? All in all it served it's purpose for the price we paid.",2017-04-22,ibis saint martin

The room is the biggest ibis room I ever stayed in my life and the massive flat screen TV were amazing. However, as I am a gold card member with Le Club Accorhotel, I asked for a welcome drink in night after 22:00 on the 4th of April. The receptionist was being silly and told us we only allow 1 drink as only 1 of us are a gold card member but we are a group of 4 people. We stayed in many other ibis and accor properties around the world before but never experience this before. A little bit disappointed and upset.",2017-04-11,ibis saint martin

tripadvisor,5 stars,"After booking this hotel and speaking with friends and family familiar with Paris, I was a bit concerned about the location. I was told by several people to be careful around the Gare du Nord as it was a sketchy area at night. My fiance and I were pleasantly surprised to find this was not the case around this hotel. Walking through the neighborhood at night did not feel unsafe at all; there were few to no people that we saw ever. Mostly people were driving in cars and on motorbikes. It was also comforting to walk by a police station on the way to and from the Louis Blanc metro station as we always saw someone posted in a window watching the street when we walked by. It did take a bit of traveling on the metro to get to most of the popular tourist attractions from the hotel. The hotel itself is about a 15-25 minute walk from Gare du Nord and only about a 5-10 minute walk from the Louis Blanc metro station. It was very convenient to get around where ever we were going with the metro and also the transfers to the RER trains. hotel itself was extremely modern and clean throughout the lobby and the rooms. The staff was extremely friendly and all of the front desk agents we interacted with spoke English fluently. The only complaint we had about the hotel was the size of the bathrooms. The toilet was placed awkwardly behind the bathroom door and the shower did not have a full door so water often got on the floor. Overall, this hotel was fantastic and relatively inexpensive for the offerings provided. We would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Paris.",2017-03-22,ibis saint martin
tripadvisor,5 stars,Nice ibis hotel. The room was nice. We were happy with the breakfast. The staff at the reception were helpful to show us how to get around on the metro. There are 3 stations near by. If I go back to Paris again would stay here.,2017-03-06,ibis saint martin
tripadvisor,5 stars,"The hotel is very strategically located with 3 Metro Stations nearby. You could walk to either depending upon your destination. Like if you are travelling to Eiffel you could board a metro from Mount Blanc change at Chausee De A'tin and debord at Iena and the transit takes just 20 minutes. The breakfast is good, cleanliness is amazing and the hotel staff is very helpful.

tripadvisor,2 stars,"Worst Check in of my life : Arrived late on cold Friday evening after a long travel; the receptionists asked me to pay the room in advance, tried with 3 different credit cards the hotel could not process the payment. I suggested that there was an issue with the hotel credit card line and and asked if I could pay in the next morning but instead I was asked to pay cash with the receptionist assuming instead that the issue was with all our cards. I did not have cash at hand so to summarize I had to find the next cash machine to retrieve cash with the same card i had used to try to pay the room. Ridiculous and ridiculous were the dimensions of the room I was given: a real cage for birds. True the wifi is working very well, the bed is comfortable and in all honesty the room has a smart set up but I have been in Paris on multiple occasions and I think this hotel is simply not worth what they charge. Lastly the water in the shower was bad smelling for the 2 days I was there , not sure if this was an issue with the hotel or with the city water but I doesn't matter I will not be back.",2017-01-15,ibis saint martin

The rooms and interior of the hotel have been completely renovated and though it's not luxurious, it's very comfortable and we directly felt ""homey"". Its proximity to our family which we visited during Christmas was the reason we chose this hotel, but we always like to return, now even more after the refurbishment. The staff was very friendly with a professional service attitude. We can really recommend this hotel for its price/performance ratio, friendly staff and good connection to Public Transportation in Paris!",2016-12-28,ibis saint martin

The location is good with close proximity to 3 metro stations and canal sint martin.. Other than that, it was a pretty standard ibis stay.. It a budget hotel so dont go expecting any luxuries..

Don't expect extra towels or anything of the sort but it is a very functional room with everything you need, clean, well located. Although it is at 10 min walk from Gare du Nord station, the environment around the hotel is clean, safe and nice. It feels like you are moving out of the Gare Du Nord nightmare to come into a quiet place like magic. The canal is just there and you have few restaurant to visit.

The location is well connected by metro as it is just 5 mins walk from the nearest metro station. There is a police station on the way from the metro to the hotel which makes it absolutely safe to return even late in the night. Since, Paris is a city where you need to be extra careful, the location gave us the confidence to come back late in the night. Room is extremely small but I think that's true in most of Paris.

tripadvisor,4 stars,"Clean hotel and rooms, nice design, room size is OK (not too small as it can often be in Paris), very comfortable beds. I liked the bathroom - new, clean and again not too small for Paris. Comfortable wardrobe. Breakfast is good (about 10 EUR and you have pastry, fruits, eggs, cheese, ham, muesli etc.). They also have a special station, where you take fruits to go after breakfast. And when the breakfast is over (it is till 10 am), they also offer the remaining pastry (croissants etc.). Very good value for money. Although I had a big issue during reservation. My booking was non-refundable, and I did it several months in advance, so they took the whole amount from my credit card once I confirmed the reservation (3 months before my visit). 1,5 months before coming I tried to modify the reservation and add 1 more person. I failed, as booking.com did not let me make any changes for a prepaid reservation. But the hotel suddenly took the whole amount from my credit card once again! I wrote to the hotel and called booking.com, and a specialist from booking.com explained it was a system error in the hotel and they would return the money to me within several days. At the same time he changed the number of persons for the room and told I would just need to pay the city tax for the 2nd person. The hotel gave me the same explanation in the email, so it was OK, and I got my money back in a week. It was not pleasant to have 350 EUR blocked like this for a week, but OK, I imagine such things can happen sometimes. What was really frustrating is that after this they took the same amout 2 more times, while I did not make any changes to the reservation. And each time the explanation was the same: ""just a system error, you will have your money back in several days, it all happens because you make changes to the reservation"". So no attempts to excuse, to admit their fault (I did not touch the reservation the 2 last times).. a friend working in hospitality told me it can never be a system error, as it is always the person who decides to block money on a card or not. Some other little things: For a double room for 2 people only 2 towels + 1 towel-rug for feet. Would be nice to at least 2 more towels of average size for hair for example. No toiletries except for 2 stuck bottles with washing gel (all-in-one - body + hair + hands). Strange and little bedside-tables, wuold be great to have more place for storage near the bed. Not a big issue and maybe my fault not to ask in advance, but: be precise when you order a taxi. Normally the rate is fixed to go to the airport and is 35 EUR. And taxi service can add 4 EUR for reservation. I asked for a taxi in advance, mentioning that it should be a usual fixed rate for the airport (but did not give the exact amount), they ordered it for me, and finally a big car (almost minibus) came and it costed 55 EUR. I asked to cancel it, they did it and in 5 min I had an ordinary car for usual price.",2016-09-02,ibis saint martin

tripadvisor,4 stars,"We stayed here for 4 nights after having tried ibis style and budget. This is the best. What I love the most is its close to train station. It took us a quite a while to find it though as there are 6-7 streets around the train station. The website of the hotel could have discribed it "" when you come out of colonel fabrien train station, head over Esso gas station. Our hotel is a few steps ahead"" But being close to train station makes a huge difference. Worth to mention, there is a bus close to hotel Bus46 going to train terminal. If you are going to take coach to other cities or going to airport, this makes it very easy as you don't have to carry your luggages down to train station( there's no elevator or escalator in most of train stations in Paris. Everything is stairs!and walking in tunnels!) The hotel room was spacious. Washroom was big enough. Shower water was strong flow. Sheets are clean and white. Bed was very comfortable. The hotel got different plug adapters to loan to you with no charge. However, house keeper knocks out door every morning even if we put up the sign of ""do not disturb"". And the Internet wasn't very good. It had difficult time even downloading pictures, not to mention movies. It has a bar but not cheap. We had a very small bottle of champion. It costed $25. Later we found out if you walk to your right coming out of the hotel, there's a bar which is 30 meters away. If you need food, there's a burger place on your way from train station. It opens very late. And there's a store selling almost everything you need. It closes early though.",2016-08-06,ibis saint martin
tripadvisor,1 stars,"The hotel shows misleading prices at the time of search and then loots its customers with higher rates when they come at the time of check-in. Further, the staff/ management at the hotel also are not cooperative at the hotel for such misleading prices being shown by the hotel on the search platform, and raise their hands. Further, the management of the hotel asked me to share my card details on e-mail which details can be clearly compromised and threatened me to cancel my booking if I do not share such details on the e-mail. I have stayed with Ibis in past several times, but this was the worst experience that I could get from any hotel in my life time till date. The reason such disastrous experience is solely attributed to hotel for displaying misleading rates and taking booking without verification (if they intend to continue with such misleading rates only), and the hotel management, who instead of helping its customers just ask them to either pay the higher rates or push off from the hotel, and also ask for sensitive details like card details to be shared on e-mail, despite raising security concerns. Choose this hotel only, if you do not have any other option. One can get much-much better hotels/ rooms and that also near to the center of Paris, at much competitive rates. Dont get trapped in the attractive rates being shown here. Its absolutely misleading and you may be required to pay double or infact much more than that. I ended up paying almost double the rates then what I had originally booked the hotel and that also more than 3-4 months before actual travel. Very unhappy with them.",2016-08-01,ibis saint martin

The bathroom could not get smaller than this. You hit everything in that small 4 walls. :) It was an experience. I might be biased as hotels in paris are usually small in size and one needs to adjust. We took this for the price else you will have better options slightly expensive but with comfortablke rooms.

tripadvisor,2 stars,"I stayed in this hotel with my wife and two grown up children for 3 nights from the 1st Aug 2015. We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary, my son's graduation from university and my daughter's 18th birthday. We had emailed ahead and informed the hotel of this and specifically asked for two rooms on the same floor. We understand none of this can be guaranteed but given the reason behind our trip we thought the hotel may have done something to accommodate us - particularly given that we advised them some 10 weeks before we were due to arrive. When we did eventually get to the hotel after a long trip from the UK we dumped our bags in reception and headed off for something to eat (we had 2 hours to kill before our two rooms were going to be ready). We got back to the hotel at 12pm only to find that we only had access to one room. We were given some lame excuse about the computer system not functioning properly and told that the other room would be ready shortly. We headed up to our room (which was only just big enough to swing a cat in) and spent the next hour taking it in turn to sit on the one chair that we had in the room. The rest of us were sprawled out on the bed - not wanting to shower or change as all our luggage was in one suitcase. Eventually our frustration got the better of us and we went back down to the reception area to confront the desk clerk. He was powerless and said he would do everything in his power to rectify the situation. We showed him a leaflet we had found in our room which stated that if the hotel failed to resolve a problem you had reported within 15 minutes you stayed the night for free. Suddenly - from speaking perfect English he managed to lose the ability to use his tongue! Finally he managed to splutter something about speaking with the manager but she would not be available until the Monday (this was Saturday morning). We went back up to our room and it was another 40 minutes or so before we got a call to go down and pickup the key for our 2nd room. It was on the 1st floor !!!!!! They had taken no notice of our request and we now had to separate our luggage and toiletries and transport them between 4 floors. We tried not to let this experience spoil our stay and forgot about the incident until it was time to check out. We lived with the inconvenience of having to get in the lift each time we wanted to get to the kids room or vice-versa. We were in two minds as to whether we should approach the manager before we left but she was in reception so we asked to have a word with her. She was obviously well versed in how to deal with these matters and had a sack full of excuses as to why we had been inconvenienced the way we had - probably all used on her foreign guests as she conveniently spoke in French whenever she did not want us to grasp what she was saying to her colleague. What annoyed us more than anything was when she told us that there was in fact another room set aside for our arrival but the previous guests had decided to extend their stay. They had been given priority over new arrivals we I found completely unacceptable. She was rude an impolite and when we mentioned the 15 minute rule she said we would just have to make a formal complaint (which I will be doing as soon as I sign off!!!). It goes without saying that I will not be staying at an IBIS hotel again and whilst this did not spoil our wonderful visit to Paris it definitely left us with a bitter taste in our mouths. And the French say we Brits are rude !!!!!!!",2015-08-11,ibis saint martin

tripadvisor,4 stars,otels in Paris are crazy expensive for what the offer. Room sizes are sometimes ridiculous. This ibis is a nice tiny hotel. Room 304 is just big enough for a week of work when I was almost out all day. Good aircon TV and shower are always appreciated and the beds and linen where up to standard but nothing special. Breakfast was included in my rate and was good enough to go out with some pan au chocolait and a double expresso. It is well located near Jaures Metro and other metro stations and next to the canal that can be a very nice walk. A good place for a stay if you are not up to tons of bars and restaurants.

When i back to the hotel, took a shower and i saw that no towels in my room. I called to reception via phone and told that 'I'm naked and wet' please give me a new towel,but She brought 20 mins after for a new towel. IBIS hotels promises that max. 15 mins satisfaction guarantee. However it's too late.. When i checked out from hotel , i complained hotel manager and remind their '15 mins. satisfaction guarantee.' She apologied to us and offer complimentary breakfast. This situation is not godd for group of IBIS hotels. Their employees must be educated. Theie front rooms have very good view for Canal Saint Martin, but rear rooms were not good view.If you want to stay this hotel,shoud request front room which are looking at canal view. The advantage is Gare du Nord is only 12 mins by walk and Metro station is only 3-4 mins walk from Hotel. If you like to walk Notre dame (central) is 25 mins walk from hotel. Thanks",2015-05-20,ibis saint martin

tripadvisor,4 stars,"I stayed here for 2 nights with my wife on our Paris vacation in July 2014. The hotel is well worth the price, a decent and safe place to sleep. In the evening we reached the hotel, canned our plan to visit Eiffel tower by the night, instead went for a walk and reached the canal side nearby. This was probably the best part of our trip. We could see a lot of young people sitting on the bank, partying, chit chatting. This made us buy couple of beers from the nearby grocery store and join them. That was vibrant Paris. On the con side I might have preferred something close to gare de lyon as my connecting train to swiss was at 6.23 and first train out of our nearest metro was 6am. Thankfully we got a taxi. If you are in a pure vacation mode with a budget in mind, I would recommend this hotel.",2014-08-05,ibis saint martin

The next day we were relocated back into a terrific quiet room and were given lovely service from the staff. I expect our start was unusual, but otherwise we were very happy after that.

tripadvisor,3 stars,There were one or two members of staff who were outstanding. There were others who were...idiots. All in all it was a perfectly reasonable stay with no real complaints except that some of the more jobsworth staff liked to charge extortionate amounts for small coffees where others simply invited us to carry on and help ourselves. Rooms were well sound proofed. Shower was blocked on arrival but a tiny bit of DIY sorted that out.,2014-05-07,ibis saint martin
tripadvisor,3 stars,"Even for ibis standards this is an average hotel. The main issues are the very basic rooms, the awkwardly shaped bathroom (depending on which room you get, there might not be any leg room when you are using the toilet), the small TVs, no kettles in the rooms and not user -friendly wifi. The rooms are clean but the area outside the entrance of the hotel is used as a smoking area (not good first impression) and there is rubbish (including used condoms) on the top of the canopy over the entrance (obviously thrown out from the windows). There are quite a few positives as well though. This is amongst the cheapest chain budget hotels in this part of Paris. The location is very convenient, only a 5' walk from a choice of three metro stations (Louis Blanc, Jaures, Colonel Fabien) with excellent connection to the network and easy access to Gare du Nord. Even better is the access to the St Martin canal, literally around the corner, which is ideal for an afternoon/evening stroll and for dining with its wonderful bistros and restaurants. We had two of our five meals in Paris in this area!",2014-04-21,ibis saint martin

tripadvisor,3 stars,"Stayed here because of its proximity to a music festival we were attending. It's not in a particularly touristy part of Paris, but very accessible to such areas via the metro. You can be at the Arch de Triomphe in about 15 minutes once on the metro. The hotel itself is not terrible but definitely not nice. Our room was so tight that the door did not open all the way to get in. I found sitting on the toilet challenging given how close the wall in front of it is to the throne itself. If you have loud neighbors, you will definitely hear them. Finally, the fire alarm went off two days in a row around 8 AM in the morning, which I almost think was a tactic to wake you up to pay for the breakfast buffet (which we did, and was pretty decent). But it is clean and very inexpensive, so you get what you pay for. But don't expect anything romantic or cool, it's just a place to lay your head. If it's not cheaper than places you consider to be nice, go for that other place. This place is worth staying in when you are looking for maximum economy.",2014-02-07,ibis saint martin

tripadvisor,4 stars,"This place is walking distance from Gard Du Nord train station, and checking in was incredibly fast, less than one minute, by a friendly receptionist. The room size is ok, the room very clean and smart with modern fittings which were all working. This is a good hotel if you are in Paris for a work trip or basic holiday, but not if you want something special or romantic. The staff were all friendly and efficient. The area is very quiet, but not dead. Across the canal are cafes and shops, and a bit down the road by the canal is a supermarket. For lunch/daytime eating very strongly recommend Le Cafe Prud'H at 208 Rue du fauberg, less than ten mins away. A very friendly place with wonderful reasonably priced food. They don't do hot meals in the evening. Didn't have breakfast there as lots of cheap cafes etc nearby. Only three small downsides. The bathroom is small (shower only) and the toilet was jammed sideways into an alcove meaning you have to use it sideways! See picture. Very odd design. Also, the doors have an automatic closing and really thump into door frames when they close, which is very noisy late at night. Another thing, small really, but it sounded like the extraction fan in the bathroom came on every few hours overnight, loud enough to wake me up as I am a light sleeper. All that said, if I had another work trip with meetings nearby wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. It was a lot nicer than several other places I stayed at in Paris over the years,",2013-09-22,ibis saint martin

There were renovations being undertaken in the hotel which might explain why in the bathroom, work on the shower seemed unfinished.

tripadvisor,4 stars,"We were only staying one night in Paris, and decided a basic hotel would meet our needs. The price we paid was correct for this range, but I am up-rating it due to fantastic customer service. We arrived earlier than the check-in time, looking to drop our bags off with the front-desk so we could go meet our friends. Instead, we were pleasantly surprised when the staff member handed us our key card and gave us directions to the room. On our way, we saw the housekeeping staff still going about their clean-up in the other rooms; that's how early we arrived. This gave us a chance not only to drop our belongings off, but to also quickly freshen up before heading out again. The room is very much ibis-style. We did have two pillows per person, which was unexpected. The place was very clean, and everything was in working order. Nothing broken, nothing looking like it's going to break, although the phone looked a little bit old (we didn't use it anyway). There was free WiFi with strong signal, and ran at a good speed. We didn't take the breakfast since bakeries are everywhere in Paris, but at 2 euros for a cup of coffee, it was about the same price as what one would pay elsewhere, and we got to take it back to our room. The bar area was quite chic, and later that evening when we came back to claim our bags, I ordered a wine to kill some time before catching the train, and it wasn't half bad. Check-out was as pleasant as check-in. The whole transaction took less than a minute and the staff member was very agreeable. They had no issues leaving our bags with them for the day. Only one small point to note for this hotel - the distance to the closest Metro we found (Louis Blanc) was about a 5-minute walk away. It may not sound far but having stayed in several other ibis hotels before, this is farther than the usual distance I've experienced in Paris. It's something to consider if travelers fatigue easily or have mobility issues. Otherwise, the location is very peaceful, quiet and feels safe. It's a definitely recommendable hotel.",2013-03-04,ibis saint martin

tripadvisor,1 stars,"Before anything else, I'd like to state that -- for Paris -- this hotel is reasonable value, clean and comfortable. It was the sort of room that you could swing a cat in, but only if it was a very patient cat that didn‚Äôt mind a few nasty cracks on the head. Unfortunately, on my second day in the hotel I stepped out for 30 minutes to visit the supermarket and came back to find my room had been burgled. All room doors swing shut of their own accord, and lock automatically -- just the same, I am in the habit of pushing the door when they shut just to double-check, so I know my room was locked when I went out. When I returned, I was at first confused why there was already a key-card in the light switch (your room key operates all the lights). Then I noticed my laptop was missing. I checked to make sure I hadn't moved it and forgotten, then immediately went and told reception. The concierge was confused and distressed by the incident, and told me the key card I found in my room was used by staff -- such as the cleaner, or someone fixing the air conditioning -- to operate the lights while in the room. He said he would ""ask"" them about my missing laptop, and advised me to go to the police. I was not offered any more explanation as to how this burglary could have happened, or any reassurance that it would be looked into further than asking staff about it. The next day on check out there was someone else on reception, so I told him about the incident too -- he had not been told, so he took a copy of my police report to share with his manager. Again, no reassurance or advice was offered. At time of writing, I have tried contacting the hotel about it, and had no response. In hindsight, since there wasn't a safe in the room I perhaps should have taken all valuables out with me, or put them in a safety deposit box: but you don't expect your locked room to be burgled by staff.",2012-11-09,ibis saint martin

Being in a noisy part of Paris (virtually opposite one of the main fire stations), sleeping or even sitting in the room with the window open was VERY noisy - close the window and find it far too hot though!!! The ""bar"" wasn't really a bar. What was in the menu was not on offer; what was on show was not on offer. Had a ""can"" of Kronenburg each night and you have to site in the breakfast buffet part of the small reception. This was not explained on the website! Poor in comparison to other Ibis Hotels we stay at and especially when compared to the one we use most often (Coquelles!).

Bathroom also fully featured in this minimalist fashon: shower and sink with liquid soap, built in hair drier, but toilet is cramped in a corner in a more than awkward position. Cleaning staff was a bit too ""enthusiastic"": removed stuff deemed as junk on their own accord without us putting it in the waste basket. Wi-fi access is well working but limited: you'll have to remember to request new access codes at the reception in every 24 hours, and enter them at each connection, which is also limited to 200 MB/24 h. Only real gripe was that the A/C had been out of order. Which would still have been OK with me, if the window hadn't been looking at the street with all kinds of traffic (including regular buses) and other noises that were multiplied by the walls near the window and across the street.

While I was waiting for the elevator, I saw a notice saying the air-conditioning system was out of order. I wasn't told this at the desk though. Thought I should have been. My room was probably one of the newly renovated ones, so everything was fine. Since the A/C broke, they actually put a fan in the room, which luckily for the kind of weather at the time was sufficient to keep the room cool. Location is okay, a short walk from Louis Blanc metro station. Not much (shops, restaurants) going on in the neighborhood. Seemed okay in terms of safety. The presence of a big police station nearby helps I guess. The night before check out though, I was told by a male receptionist that there might be a train strike the next day (a Saturday). So I took his advice and book a taxi for the next morning. He told me the fare would be 40‚Ç¨ (as agreed between hotel and taxi company) and that the journey would take 2 hours with traffic. I thought that was a bit steep but not wanting to risk missing my flight, I agreed.

The hotel is situated a few minutes walking distance between two metro stops and there are other within 10 minutes. It is not the smartest neighbourhood, but I did feel threatened or uncomfortable, in fact I liked the mix of cultures and peoples. There is a Police station that you pass on the way to one of the metro stations. The hotel provides the good quality of service I have come to expect from Ibis, with a few provisos. My room was overheated and although there is air conditioning that works, it does make a noise which means it is disturbing at night. While I was there the single lift broke down, fortunately after I had got my suitcase to the room, but I was on the fourth floor and it took them over 24hrs to repair it.

tripadvisor,3 stars,"We travel often between France and England, and regularly require accomodation near to either Gare du Nord or Gare de L'est. Normally we use the Ibis hotels closest to the stations - but during our last trip those hotels were overly expensive or booked out. We decided to try the Ibis Jemmapes, despite the rather dire reviews posted here. It's certainly not a place for a long romantic stay, but for one night as a stopover in Paris it was acceptable. It took about 15 minutes on foot from either of the stations - but you should use a map if you're unfamiliar with the area. The hotel isn't quite as nice nor as new as other Ibis hotels in Paris we've tried - but the staff we're very helpful, and the room was adequately clean, and had a bath, not just a shower. No idea about the hotel restaurant, nor breakfast, since we always eat out at restaurants in Paris, and go to cafes for breakfast. Within a few minutes walk there is plenty of choice - Paris is an easy place to find whatever kind of food you want.

First of all, I was the first to arrive at this hotel in Paris. It is close to Gare de l'est and Gare du Nord, and it is close to the metro stations Louis Blanc and colonel Fabien. It is therefor very central if you need fast access to the metro. First of all, this hotel is not very huge. But at the webpage at accorhotels.com, they said that we would be served a welcome drink to the hotel. They never offered any welcome drink!

The phone did not work at all, so when we complained about this, it was not fixed at all. But the hotel had wireless internet. Good for that, even it is not free. So when I placed my laptop on the table, I sudden discovered small housefly. It was not only ONE, but at least 10! And they where all over. After some days, the small flys was all over the bed, the clothes, the drinks... you name it. The last night I really needed to itch all over my body, because I felt to have all this small animals over my body. So thanks good that I leave the hotel. I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL NEXT TIME!",2006-09-04,ibis saint martin
